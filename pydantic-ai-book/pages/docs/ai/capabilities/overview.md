# Capabilities

A capability is a reusable, composable unit of agent behavior. Instead of threading multiple arguments through your `Agent` constructor — [instructions](/docs/ai/core-concepts/agent/#instructions) here, [model settings](/docs/ai/core-concepts/agent/#model-run-settings) there, a [toolset](/docs/ai/tools-toolsets/toolsets/) somewhere else, a [history processor](/docs/ai/core-concepts/message-history/#processing-message-history) on yet another parameter — you can bundle related behavior into a single capability and pass it via the [`capabilities`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.__init__) parameter.

Capabilities can provide any combination of:

- **Tools** — via[toolsets](/docs/ai/tools-toolsets/toolsets/) or[native tools](/docs/ai/tools-toolsets/native-tools/)
- **Lifecycle hooks** — intercept and modify model requests, tool calls, and the overall run
- **Instructions** — static or dynamic[instruction](/docs/ai/core-concepts/agent/#instructions) additions
- **Model settings** — static or per-step[model settings](/docs/ai/core-concepts/agent/#model-run-settings)
- **Models** — static or adaptive model selection and application-specific model ID resolution

This makes them the primary extension point for Pydantic AI. Whether you’re building a memory system, a guardrail, a cost tracker, or an approval workflow, a capability is the right abstraction.

Capabilities can be always-on or [loaded by the model on demand](/docs/ai/capabilities/on-demand/). The [capability index below](#available-capabilities) covers Pydantic AI and [Pydantic AI Harness](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/). [Third-party packages](/docs/ai/capabilities/third-party/) provide many more capabilities, and you can define your own [declaratively](#bundling-behavior-with-capability) or by [subclassing](/docs/ai/capabilities/custom/). To run agents durably across failures, restarts, and long waits, see [Durable Execution](/docs/ai/capabilities/durable_execution/overview/).

Capabilities come from two packages, and they compose with each other and with capabilities you define. Core (`pydantic-ai`) ships the capabilities that require model or framework support: provider-native tools, provider APIs, and deep loop integration. **[Pydantic AI Harness](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/)**, the official capability library and harness for Pydantic AI, ships everything else, from single capabilities to [complete agents](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/coder/). The **Package** column says which; every entry links to its documentation.

Complete agent stacks as regular combined capabilities: one import gives you a working agent, and you can take either apart into the blocks below.

| Harness | Package | What it provides | 
|---|---|---|
| [Coder](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/coder/) | Harness | A complete coding-agent stack: files, shell, repo context, planning, a read-only explorer sub-agent, and context controls |

How the agent spends its context window: the difference between an agent that degrades over a long run and one that doesn’t, and between paying for tokens N times or once.

| Capability | Package | What it does | 
|---|---|---|
| [Code Mode](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/code-mode/) | Harness | The model writes one Python script that calls many tools inside a [Monty](https://github.com/pydantic/monty) sandbox: one round-trip instead of N, and intermediate results never enter the context window |

The authoring primitives, [`Capability`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.Capability) for [bundling behavior without subclassing](#bundling-behavior-with-capability) and [`Toolset`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.Toolset) for wrapping an [`AbstractToolset`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/toolsets/#pydantic_ai.toolsets.AbstractToolset), are covered below. [ACP](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/acp/) *(experimental, Harness)* serves any agent to editors like Zed over the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com). Capabilities that can be declared in [YAML/JSON agent specs](/docs/ai/core-concepts/agent-spec/#capability-spec-syntax) are listed there.

[Instructions](/docs/ai/core-concepts/agent/#instructions) and [model settings](/docs/ai/core-concepts/agent/#model-run-settings) are configured directly via the `instructions` and `model_settings` parameters on `Agent` (or [`AgentSpec`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.AgentSpec)). Capabilities are for behavior that goes beyond simple configuration — tools, lifecycle hooks, and custom extensions. They compose well, especially when you want to reuse the same configuration across multiple agents or load it from a [spec file](/docs/ai/core-concepts/agent-spec/).

You don’t need a subclass to define a capability of your own: [`Capability`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.Capability) bundles instructions, function tools, and [toolsets](/docs/ai/tools-toolsets/toolsets/) declaratively — think of it as defining a skill:

Add `defer_loading=True` and the bundle becomes an [on-demand capability](/docs/ai/capabilities/on-demand/) that stays collapsed to a one-line catalog entry until the model loads it — like [Agent Skills](/docs/ai/capabilities/on-demand/#loading-skills-from-markdown-files), which you can wrap in a `Capability` directly. See [The `Capability` convenience class](/docs/ai/capabilities/on-demand/#the-capability-convenience-class) for the full API. For behavior beyond instructions, tools, and toolsets — lifecycle hooks, model settings, native tools — subclass [`AbstractCapability`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.AbstractCapability) as covered in [Building Custom Capabilities](/docs/ai/capabilities/custom/).

Reusable capabilities can publish typed [`CapabilityEvent`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/messages/#pydantic_ai.messages.CapabilityEvent)s for coordination and observability. Give an event family a stable namespace, define each payload as a dataclass, and emit it from an async capability hook or capability-contributed tool by awaiting [`ctx.emit()`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.emit):

*(This example is complete, it can be run “as is”)*

Keep the namespace in a module-level constant and give it the capability’s name or [`id`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.AbstractCapability.id): every event in the family repeats it, and it’s the prefix subscribers match on.

A capability publishes capability events specifically, and emitting an application [`CustomEvent`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/messages/#pydantic_ai.messages.CustomEvent) from one raises a [`UserError`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/exceptions/#pydantic_ai.exceptions.UserError); see [Which event type do I use?](/docs/ai/core-concepts/agent/#which-event-type) for the split. The payload cannot use the field names the envelope needs for itself: `data`, `capability_id`, `tool_call_id`, `tool_name`, and `event_kind` are rejected when the class is defined.

Pydantic AI stamps the emitting capability’s run id as `capability_id`. For a capability you gave an `id`, that is the `id`. For one you did not, it is a handle the framework mints for that run — `'<file_reader:4f3a9c>'` — which differs every run and must not be matched on; give the capability an explicit `id` if a subscriber needs to recognize it. Events emitted by its tools also receive `tool_call_id` and `tool_name`. They surface on the [agent run event stream](/docs/ai/core-concepts/agent/#streaming-all-events) but are internal coordination signals, so UI adapters do not forward them by default. A protocol adapter can override [`handle_capability_event()`](/docs/ai/api/ui/base/#pydantic_ai.ui.UIEventStream.handle_capability_event) to map one onto its own protocol, building the payload itself as `CapabilityEvent` has no `to_payload()`. An application that wants to expose one to a frontend can instead listen for it with [`@agent.on_event`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.on_event) and emit an application `CustomEvent` carrying the public payload:

*(This example is complete, it can be run “as is”)*

The listener belongs to the application rather than to a capability, so it is one of the places application `CustomEvent`s can be emitted. [`Hooks.on.event`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.Hooks) does the same job when you want a `Hooks` capability anyway — for the other [hook families](/docs/ai/core-concepts/hooks/), or to choose where it sits among the other capabilities.

The namespace and event name form the serialized `kind` (for example, `workspace.file_read`), and the event name is derived from the class name unless you pass an explicit `name=`. A namespace is required: defining a `CapabilityEvent` subclass without one raises `TypeError` there and then, rather than letting an unnamespaced event reach the stream. You only give it once per family, though — an event subclassing another capability event inherits its namespace and contributes just its own name, so a shared base is the tidiest way to define a family — and a subclass can pass its own `namespace=` to move out of the one it inherited. Mark a base that only carries the namespace and fields common to the family `abstract=True`, and it stays out of the registry and can’t be emitted itself, while its subclasses register as usual. Decorate it with `@dataclass` like any other event: an undecorated base contributes no fields at all, which is rejected rather than left to surface as a payload quietly missing them. The `kind` is the event’s wire identifier, so renaming the class renames the tag with it, breaking compatibility wherever events outlive the emitting process — [durable execution](/docs/ai/capabilities/durable_execution/overview/) histories and caches, persisted event logs, subscribers matching on the kind. A capability published as a library should pin `name=` on each of its events. Kinds are registered when the class is defined and must be unique within the process; re-executing the same class definition (as when re-running a notebook cell) replaces the registration. Import the module defining an event before creating the adapter that deserializes it, as each pydantic `TypeAdapter` captures the kinds registered when it is created. Otherwise the event becomes an [`UnknownCapabilityEvent`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/messages/#pydantic_ai.messages.UnknownCapabilityEvent) and a `UserWarning` is emitted, without losing payload fields; serializing it again preserves the wire representation so a later consumer can recover the typed event.

Use [`@on_event`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.on_event) on an async capability method to react to selected event classes. For example, a repository-context capability can enqueue instructions immediately after a file-system capability reports reading a repository guidance file:

Filtering is explicit: the decorator uses `isinstance` against the classes passed to it. A bare `@on_event` receives the full [`AgentStreamEvent`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/messages/#pydantic_ai.messages.AgentStreamEvent) union, including model response deltas, tool call and result events, deferred and [enqueued-message](/docs/ai/core-concepts/message-history/#injecting-messages-mid-run) events, [custom events](/docs/ai/core-concepts/agent/#custom-events), and capability events.

Name the classes when you can. Beyond narrowing the `event` argument for the type checker, the classes are what let dispatch skip a capability without descending into it: a capability is only woken for events one of its listeners accepts. A bare `@on_event` — or an overridden [`on_event()`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.AbstractCapability.on_event), whose dispatch isn’t knowable in advance — opts that capability into every event, and a capability that combines others reports the union of its children’s. If you override `on_event()` and can describe what it dispatches, override [`listens_to()`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.AbstractCapability.listens_to) alongside it to say so.

Listeners run sequentially in capability order, and marked methods within one capability run in definition order. The emitting capability also receives its own events. By default, listeners run when the event reaches its position in the stream, so listener ordering always matches stream ordering and listener work does not add to the emitter’s latency. For events emitted during tool execution, listeners run before the next model request. An event emitted during `before_model_request` may only reach listeners after that request begins, with the same as-soon-as-possible timing as [`ctx.enqueue()`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.enqueue).

Decision events that need listener mutations before the emitter continues declare `dispatch='immediate'` on the event class:

Building on the workspace capability above, a write can announce itself before it happens and let a listener veto it:

`emit` returns only once every listener has run, and returns the same instance it was given.

So the decision is readable immediately after, on either the returned event or the emitter's own reference.

*(This example is complete, it can be run “as is”)*

For immediate dispatch, Pydantic AI buffers the event before invoking listeners, but stream consumers only receive it once all listeners have run, so they never observe a decision half-made. Attribution is stamped on the event in place, so after `await ctx.emit(event)` the emitter can read `event.cancelled` off its own reference (the same instance `emit` returns), and an event emitted by a listener appears after the decision event in the stream. Inline events are still delivered exactly once, including when the same event instance is re-emitted. Stream-dispatch listeners run inside user-defined [`wrap_run_event_stream()`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.AbstractCapability.wrap_run_event_stream) wrappers.

[`WebSearch`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.WebSearch), [`WebFetch`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.WebFetch), [`ImageGeneration`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.ImageGeneration), [`XSearch`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.XSearch), and [`MCP`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.MCP) each cover a single capability (web search, URL fetch, image generation, X search, MCP) across two implementations:

- **Native** — invoked by the model provider when the model supports it. The work happens on the provider’s side (e.g. Anthropic’s web search runs server-side, returning results inline).
- **Local** — runs in your Python process. Used when the model doesn’t support the native tool; your code does the work (e.g. calling DuckDuckGo directly).

| Capability | Local fallback | Notes | 
|---|---|---|
| [`WebSearch`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.WebSearch) | `local='duckduckgo'` or`local=True` (DuckDuckGo) | Requires the `duckduckgo` optional group | 
| [`WebFetch`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.WebFetch) | `local=True` (markdownify-based fetch) | Requires the `web-fetch` optional group | 
| [`ImageGeneration`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.ImageGeneration) | Direct model via `local=ImageGenerator(...)` or`fallback_image_model='provider:image-model'` , or subagent via`fallback_subagent_model=` | The direct routes use the [direct image-generation API](/docs/ai/guides/image-generation/) without a subagent | 
| [`XSearch`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.XSearch) | Subagent via `fallback_subagent_model=` | No default non-xAI fallback; set `fallback_subagent_model` to an xAI model that supports[`XSearchTool`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/native_tools/#pydantic_ai.native_tools.XSearchTool) | 
| [`MCP`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.MCP) | Direct connection to the MCP server (the default) | Accepts any [`MCPToolset`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/mcp/#pydantic_ai.mcp.MCPToolset) input; transport is auto-detected from a URL | 

Because these capabilities contribute model-facing tools, their `id`, `description`, and `defer_loading` fields are meaningful: set `description` and `defer_loading` when that tool should stay hidden until the model loads the matching workflow with the `load_capability` tool. Each of these covers a single fixed concern, so `id` already defaults to a stable value (`'web_search'`, `'web_fetch'`, `'image_generation'`, `'x_search'`; `MCP` derives one from the server URL) — which is what [durable execution](/docs/ai/capabilities/durable_execution/overview/) identifies the toolset they contribute by, so it works unconfigured. Set `id` only to rename it, and see [building custom capabilities](/docs/ai/capabilities/custom/) for what happens when two share one. This includes [`ImageGeneration`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.ImageGeneration) when image generation should only be available for an image-specific workflow, whether it resolves to a native image tool, a direct image-model fallback, or the subagent fallback.

A [`Capability`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.Capability) contributing several [toolsets](/docs/ai/tools-toolsets/toolsets/) names each one `'{capability_id}_{index}'` — those are the ids [durable execution](/docs/ai/capabilities/durable_execution/overview/) registers them under.

Configure each side via the `native=` and `local=` kwargs. `native=` accepts `True` (use the capability’s default [native tool](/docs/ai/tools-toolsets/native-tools/) instance), `False` (disable native), an explicit instance like `WebSearchTool(...)` for fine-grained config, or a callable taking [`RunContext`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext) that returns a native tool or `None` (see [Dynamic Configuration](/docs/ai/tools-toolsets/native-tools/#dynamic-configuration)). A factory that returns `None` omits the native tool for that request. `local=` accepts `True` (the bundled local fallback, on capabilities that have one — `WebSearch` and `WebFetch`), `False` (disable local), a named strategy string where supported, or any callable, [`Tool`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.Tool), or [`AbstractToolset`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/toolsets/#pydantic_ai.toolsets.AbstractToolset) — and, on `ImageGeneration`, an [`ImageGenerator`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/images/#pydantic_ai.images.ImageGenerator). Optional installs needed for the local fallback are opt-in — the capability raises a [`UserError`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/exceptions/#pydantic_ai.exceptions.UserError) at construction (with an install hint) when you ask for a local strategy whose extra isn’t installed.

`MCP` defaults the other way from the others: because MCP carries credentials, it runs locally by default and you opt into native MCP with `native=True`. The others default to native and you opt into local with `local=`.

[`XSearch`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.XSearch) is slightly different from [`WebSearch`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.WebSearch) and [`WebFetch`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.WebFetch): there is no default non-xAI fallback. If your agent is not running on an xAI model, set `fallback_subagent_model` explicitly to an xAI model that supports [`XSearchTool`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/native_tools/#pydantic_ai.native_tools.XSearchTool).

Some constraint fields require the native tool (the bundled local fallback can’t enforce them) — passing them locks the capability to the native path. If the model doesn’t support the native tool, the capability raises a [`UserError`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/exceptions/#pydantic_ai.exceptions.UserError).

All five capabilities are subclasses of [`NativeOrLocalTool`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/capabilities/#pydantic_ai.capabilities.NativeOrLocalTool), which you can use directly or subclass to build your own provider-adaptive tools. For example, to pair [`CodeExecutionTool`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/native_tools/#pydantic_ai.native_tools.CodeExecutionTool) with a local fallback:

Third-party packages publish capabilities of their own — see [Third-Party Capabilities](/docs/ai/capabilities/third-party/) for the ecosystem, and [Publishing capabilities](/docs/ai/capabilities/custom/#publishing-capabilities) for making your own capability available to others.
