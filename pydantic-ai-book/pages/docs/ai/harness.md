# Overview

**The batteries for your [Pydantic AI](/docs/ai/) agent.**

Pydantic AI’s [capabilities](/docs/ai/capabilities/overview/) and [hooks](/docs/ai/core-concepts/hooks/) API is how you give an agent its harness — bundles of tools, lifecycle hooks, instructions, and model settings that extend what the agent can do without any framework changes.

**Pydantic AI Harness** is the official capability library for Pydantic AI, maintained by the [Pydantic AI](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai) team. Pydantic AI core ships the capabilities that require model or framework support, plus the ones fundamental to every agent — [web search](/docs/ai/capabilities/web-search/), [tool search](/docs/ai/capabilities/tool-search/), [thinking](/docs/ai/capabilities/thinking/). Everything else lives here: standalone building blocks you pick and choose to turn your agent into a coding agent, a research assistant, or anything else. This is also where new capabilities start — as they stabilize and prove themselves broadly essential, they can graduate into core.

Pydantic AI core ships the agent loop, model providers, the capabilities/hooks abstraction, and two kinds of capabilities:

- **Capabilities that require model or framework support** — anything backed by provider native tools (like[image generation](/docs/ai/capabilities/image-generation/) ), provider-specific APIs (like[compaction](/docs/ai/capabilities/compaction/) via the OpenAI or Anthropic APIs), or deep agent graph integration (like[tool search](/docs/ai/capabilities/tool-search/) and[on-demand loading](/docs/ai/capabilities/on-demand/) ). These go hand-in-hand with model class code and need to ship together.
- **Capabilities that are fundamental to the agent experience** — things nearly every agent benefits from, like[web search](/docs/ai/capabilities/web-search/) ,[web fetch](/docs/ai/capabilities/web-fetch/) ,[thinking](/docs/ai/capabilities/thinking/) , and[MCP](/docs/ai/capabilities/mcp/) . These feel like qualities of the agent itself, not accessories. See[built-in capabilities](/docs/ai/capabilities/overview/#built-in-capabilities) for the full list.

**Pydantic AI Harness** is where everything else lives: standalone capabilities that make specific categories of agents powerful, or that are still finding their final shape. Context management, memory, guardrails, file system access, code execution, multi-agent orchestration — these are the building blocks you pick and choose based on what your agent needs to do.

The harness is also where new capabilities *start*. It ships as a separate package so capabilities can iterate faster without the strict backward-compatibility requirements of core. As a capability stabilizes and proves itself broadly essential, it can graduate into core — [code mode](/docs/ai/harness/code-mode) is an early candidate.

Many capabilities benefit from a “fall up” pattern: they typically start as a local implementation that works with every model, then gain provider-native support that uses the provider’s built-in API when available — auto-switching between the two. This is how [web search](/docs/ai/capabilities/web-search/), [web fetch](/docs/ai/capabilities/web-fetch/), and [image generation](/docs/ai/capabilities/image-generation/) already work in core, and the same approach is coming for skills, code mode, and context compaction.

Some capabilities need an extra to pull in their optional dependencies:

The `code-mode` extra is also supported as an alias for `codemode`.

Requires Python 3.10+ and `pydantic-ai-slim>=2.18.0`.

Install the harness alongside the Pydantic AI extras this example uses:

```
import logfire
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import MCP, WebSearch
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode
# See https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/integrations/logfire/ for setup details.
logfire.configure()
logfire.instrument_pydantic_ai()
agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-opus-4-7',
    capabilities=[
        # Wraps every tool into a single run_code tool, sandboxed by Monty
        # (https://github.com/pydantic/monty -- pulled in by the [code-mode] extra).
        # The model writes Python that calls multiple tools with loops, conditionals,
        # asyncio.gather, and local filtering -- one model round-trip for N tool calls.
        CodeMode(),
        # Connect to any MCP server -- here, the open-source Hacker News server
        # (https://github.com/cyanheads/hn-mcp-server). native=False forces the
        # local MCP toolset so CodeMode can wrap the tools; without it,
        # providers that natively support MCP server connectors execute the tools
        # server-side and bypass the sandbox.
        MCP('https://hn.caseyjhand.com/mcp', native=False),
        # Provider-adaptive web search; native=False routes through the local
        # DuckDuckGo fallback (the [duckduckgo] extra above) so CodeMode can batch
        # web searches alongside the HN calls in a single run_code.
        WebSearch(native=False),
    ],
)
result = agent.run_sync(
    "Across the top, best, and 'show HN' Hacker News feeds, find the most-discussed "
    "story with at least 100 points. Pull its comment thread, its submitter's profile, "
    "and any web coverage. Summarize what you find in one paragraph."
)
print(result.output)
"""
The most-discussed HN story across top/best/show clearing 100 points is "Vibe coding
and agentic engineering are getting closer than I'd like" by Simon Willison (748 points,
853 comments, on the Best feed), submitted by long-time HNer e12e. The piece argues
that the two modes Willison once kept mentally separate -- throwaway "vibe coding" and
disciplined "agentic engineering" -- are blurring, since agents like Claude Code now
reliably handle non-trivial tasks like "build a JSON API endpoint that runs a SQL query"
with tests and docs on the first pass. The HN thread is unusually substantive, with
commenters debating whether LLMs created or merely *exposed* sloppy engineering
practices and warning of a "normalization of deviance" as engineers stop reviewing diffs.

Each capability is a self-contained battery you drop into an agent’s `capabilities=[...]` list. They compose with each other and with Pydantic AI’s [built-in capabilities](/docs/ai/capabilities/overview/).

| Capability | What it does | Extra | 
|---|---|---|
| [Code Mode](/docs/ai/harness/code-mode) | Wraps the agent’s tools into a single `run_code` tool, sandboxed by[Monty](https://github.com/pydantic/monty) . The model writes Python that calls the tools as functions — with loops, conditionals,`asyncio.gather` , and local filtering — collapsing N tool calls into one model round-trip. | `codemode` | 
| [Skills](/docs/ai/harness/skills) | Loads Agent Skill instructions only when the model needs them. | `skills` | 
| [FileSystem](/docs/ai/harness/filesystem) | Sandboxed file access scoped to a root directory: read, write, edit, search, and find files. Rejects path traversal above the root, resolves symlinks before authorizing, and keeps `.git/` ,`.env` , key files, and secrets read-only by default. | — | 
| [Shell](/docs/ai/harness/shell) | Command execution in a subprocess rooted at a working directory, gated by allowlists, denylists, timeouts, and optional environment-variable stripping (including a preset for common LLM provider credentials). | — | 
| [Repo Context](/docs/ai/harness/repo-context) | Auto-loads repo context — `CLAUDE.md` /`AGENTS.md` and repository structure — so the agent starts a run already oriented in the project. | — | 
| [Pydantic AI Docs](/docs/ai/harness/pydantic-ai-docs) | An on-demand `read_pyai_docs` tool that pulls Pydantic AI documentation into the run when the agent needs it, instead of preloading it. | — | 
| [Exa Search](/docs/ai/harness/exa-search) | Web research backed by the [Exa](https://exa.ai) search API:`web_search` returns results with their most relevant excerpts,`get_page` reads a specific URL in full, and opt-in`deep_search` synthesizes a cited answer in one call. Output is budgeted per tool. | `exa` | 
| [Compaction](/docs/ai/harness/compaction) | Keeps a run within token limits: sliding-window trimming, LLM-powered summarization of older messages, and warnings before the context or iteration ceiling is hit. | — | 
| [Tool Output Limits](/docs/ai/harness/tool-output-limits) | Reduces an oversized tool return when it is produced — truncate, spill to a queryable file, or summarize — so a large payload does not persist in history and get re-sent every request. | — | 
| [Warn On Cache Busts](/docs/ai/harness/warn-on-cache-busts) | Warns when a run’s prompt-cache hit collapses between model requests — a moved cacheable prefix or an expired provider cache — reading the provider’s own `cache_read_tokens` verdict. | — | 
| [Step Persistence](/docs/ai/harness/step-persistence) | Saves and restores full conversation state; snapshot, resume ( `continue_run` ), and fork (`fork_run` ) a run. In-memory, file, SQLite, and MongoDB backends. | `mongodb` (Mongo backend only) | 
| [Conversation Search](/docs/ai/harness/conversation-search) | A dependency-free BM25 `search_conversation_history` tool over the history`StepPersistence` stores: recall turns that compaction dropped from the live context, and past runs in the same store. | — | 
| [Media](/docs/ai/harness/media) | Offloads large `BinaryContent` and large text parts to content-addressed stores (disk, SQLite, S3, MongoDB) so big payloads do not bloat message history. | `mongodb` (Mongo store only) | 
| [Subagents](/docs/ai/harness/subagents) | Delegates subtasks to specialized child agents through a delegate tool. | — | 
| [Dynamic Workflow](/docs/ai/harness/dynamic-workflow) | Orchestrates sub-agents from a model-written Python script — fan-out, chaining, and voting in a single tool call. | `dynamic-workflow` | 
| [Planning](/docs/ai/harness/planning) | Breaks a complex task into a structured plan before execution and tracks progress against it. | — | 
| [System Reminders](/docs/ai/harness/system-reminders) | Re-injects behavioral guidance mid-run — on a cadence or reactively from a condition — to counter instruction fade in long sessions, without invalidating the prompt cache. | — | 
| [Memory](/docs/ai/harness/memory) | Gives an agent a persistent, namespaced notebook with bounded prompt injection, on-demand search, and concurrency-safe stores. | — | 
| [Runtime Capability Creation](/docs/ai/harness/capability-creation) | Lets an agent create, validate, and persist Pydantic AI capabilities during one run for the orchestrator to load on the next run. | — | 
| [Guardrails](/docs/ai/harness/guardrails) | Validates user input, tool calls and their results, and model output — block or redact, with structured results. | — | 
| [Managed Prompt](/docs/ai/harness/managed-prompt) | Backs an agent’s instructions with a [Logfire-managed prompt](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/reference/advanced/prompt-management/) , so you can version, label, and roll out prompt changes from the Logfire UI without redeploying — with a code default that keeps the agent working when no remote value is available. | `logfire` | 
| [StackOne](/docs/ai/harness/stackone) | Actions on the user’s SaaS accounts (HRIS, ATS, CRM, and more) via the [StackOne](https://www.stackone.com) integration platform: API-key auth, account scoping, action filtering, and a search/execute mode for large catalogs. | `stackone` | 
| [ACP](/docs/ai/harness/acp)*(experimental)* | Serves an agent to editors (Zed, etc.) over the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) — streamed text, diff-rendered edits, and tool approval. | `acp` | 

Most capabilities are stable within the [version policy](#version-policy) below. [ACP](/docs/ai/harness/acp) is the exception — it is still experimental, imported from `pydantic_ai_harness.experimental.acp`, and may change or be removed in a future release.

[Capabilities](/docs/ai/capabilities/custom/) are the primary extension point for Pydantic AI. Any of the capabilities in this library can serve as a reference for building your own.

Publishing as a standalone package? Use the `pydantic-ai-<name>` naming convention — see [Publishing capability packages](/docs/ai/guides/extensibility/#publishing-capability-packages).

Pydantic AI Harness uses **0.x versioning** to signal that APIs are still stabilizing. During 0.x, minor releases (0.1 -> 0.2) may include breaking changes — renamed parameters, changed defaults, restructured APIs — while patch releases (0.1.0 -> 0.1.1) will not intentionally break existing behavior. All breaking changes are documented in release notes with migration guidance. This is why the harness is a separate package from [Pydantic AI](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai), which has a [stricter version policy](/docs/ai/project/version-policy/). As the core capabilities stabilize, the library will move toward 1.0 with matching stability guarantees.
