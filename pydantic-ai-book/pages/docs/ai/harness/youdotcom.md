# You.com

`YouSearch` and `YouResearch` give an agent web research tools backed by the
[You.com](https://you.com) APIs. `YouSearch` adds `web_search` and `get_page`,
for surveying the web and reading one page in full. `YouResearch` adds
`answer`, `research`, and `finance_research`, for cited answers to questions a
single lookup cannot settle.

While Pydantic AI Harness is on 0.x releases, the API may change between minor releases; when it does, deprecation warnings and release-note migration guidance tell you (or your agent) exactly how to upgrade. See the [version policy](/docs/ai/harness/#version-policy).

Some search tools return only a title and a snippet, so the agent has to fetch the page before it can judge the source. Others return the whole page, which fills the context with text the agent throws away. And some questions are not a lookup at all: answering them takes many searches, reading across the results, and writing up an answer with citations.

`YouSearch` and `YouResearch` wrap the You.com search, page, and research APIs
as two [capabilities](/docs/ai/capabilities/overview/). Each brings its tools,
a limit on how much text those tools return, and short research guidance for
the system prompt.

Install the `youdotcom` extra and set the `YDC_API_KEY` environment variable
(create a key at [https://api.you.com](https://api.you.com); the legacy `YOU_API_KEY_AUTH` is also
honored). The examples below use an Anthropic model and `Agent.from_file`, so
they also pull in the `anthropic` provider and the `spec` YAML support:

Then pass the capabilities to an `Agent` via the `capabilities` parameter:

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import YouResearch, YouSearch
agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', capabilities=[YouSearch(), YouResearch()])
result = agent.run_sync('What changed in the latest stable Python release?')
print(result.output)
```
Use `YouSearch` on its own if you only need search and page reads.

| Tool | Capability | Purpose | 
|---|---|---|
| `web_search` | `YouSearch` | Search the web and return the top `num_results` pages, each with title, URL, and its most relevant excerpts. | 
| `get_page` | `YouSearch` | Retrieve the markdown of one specific URL — a promising `web_search` hit, or a URL the user provided. | 
| `answer` | `YouResearch` | Get a synthesized answer with citations, grounded in live web results, in one call. | 
| `research` | `YouResearch` | Run multi-step research that reads across many sources and returns a thorough, cited answer. | 
| `finance_research` | `YouResearch` | The finance-tuned counterpart of `research` , for companies, markets, and instruments. | 

`web_search` returns short excerpts from each page rather than the whole page,
so looking over several sources stays cheap. The agent then reads a page it
picks with `get_page`. Set `extraction_mode='full_page'` to get each result’s
full markdown instead.

`get_page` and full-page `web_search` text are capped at `max_text_chars`
characters, keeping the **head** (a page’s lead carries the substance); when a
page exceeds the cap the output ends with a
`[... page text truncated at N characters]` marker. The number of results is
limited the same way: `num_results` is sent to You.com, and applied again to
the response that comes back.

A `web_search` query that matches nothing is a valid answer, not an error: the
tool returns `No results found for {query!r}.`. Other failures reach the model
as a [`ModelRetry`](/docs/ai/tools-toolsets/tools-advanced/#tool-retries): a URL or
question that comes back empty, a rate limit, a parameter You.com rejected
(422), or a temporary API or network problem. The run keeps going, and the
model can fix the URL, reword the question, or try again. Authentication,
billing, and permission failures (401/402/403) are things you have to fix in
your own setup, so they stop the run.

Use `answer` for a direct question you expect one call to settle. Use
`research` when the question needs many searches and a write-up across the
sources. `finance_research` is `research` tuned for financial analysis.

`research` waits for its result rather than handing back a job to poll, and
deep and exhaustive research routinely take minutes, so `timeout_ms` defaults
to 10 minutes. How hard it works is set by `research_effort`: `lite`,
`standard`, `deep`, or `exhaustive`. You.com also has a `frontier` level, but
it only runs as a background job, so this capability does not offer it.
`finance_research` has its own `finance_effort`: `deep` or `exhaustive`.

```
from pydantic_ai_harness import YouResearch
YouResearch(research_effort='deep')
```
Set `output_schema` to a JSON schema to have `research` return structured
output (written out as JSON) instead of prose. You.com rejects an
`output_schema` when `research_effort` is `'lite'`, so asking for both raises
an error when you create the capability.

Every tool returns a
[`ToolReturn`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/tools-toolsets/tools-advanced/#advanced-tool-returns).
Its `return_value` is the text the model sees, with a `Sources:` block added
when the tool has citations. Its `metadata['sources']` holds the same sources
as `YouSource` records (`{'url': ..., 'title': ...}`). `web_search` also puts
the response’s `search_uuid` and `latency` in metadata, for tracing. The model
does not see metadata: your application reads it from the `ToolReturnPart` in
the message history, so you can show citations without parsing any text:

```
from pydantic_ai.messages import ModelRequest, ToolReturnPart
for message in result.all_messages():
    if isinstance(message, ModelRequest):
        for part in message.parts:
            if isinstance(part, ToolReturnPart) and part.metadata is not None:
                for source in part.metadata.get('sources', []):
                    print(source['url'], source['title'])
```
`YouSearch` adds short research guidance to the system prompt: search wide
with `web_search` first, read the most promising pages in full with `get_page`
before drawing conclusions, prefer primary sources, and cite the URLs you used.
`YouResearch` adds guidance on when to use `answer`, `research`, and
`finance_research`. Both tell the model to treat the web content it fetches as
untrusted data, not as instructions to follow. On either capability, set
`guidance` to your own text to replace the default, or to `''` to add nothing.

Every field of `YouSearch` with its default:

```
from pydantic_ai_harness import YouSearch
YouSearch(
    num_results=10,              # results per web_search call (1 to 20)
    extraction_mode='highlights',  # 'highlights' excerpts, or 'full_page' markdown
    max_text_chars=10_000,       # get_page / full-page text cap, in characters
    include_domains=[],          # only return results from these domains (allowlist)
    exclude_domains=[],          # never return results from these domains (denylist)
    boost_domains=[],            # re-rank these domains higher without excluding others
    freshness=None,              # 'day' | 'week' | 'month' | 'year' | 'YYYY-MM-DDtoYYYY-MM-DD'
    country=None,                # two-letter country code to focus results
    guidance=None,               # None = default instructions, '' = none, str = custom
    timeout_ms=60_000,           # per-request timeout for the default client
    client=None,                 # YouClient -- None builds youdotcom.You from YDC_API_KEY
)
```
Every field of `YouResearch` with its default:

```
from pydantic_ai_harness import YouResearch
YouResearch(
    research_effort='standard',  # 'lite' | 'standard' | 'deep' | 'exhaustive'
    finance_effort='deep',       # 'deep' | 'exhaustive'
    include_domains=[],          # only draw from these domains (allowlist)
    exclude_domains=[],          # never draw from these domains (denylist)
    boost_domains=[],            # re-rank these domains higher
    freshness=None,              # 'day' | 'week' | 'month' | 'year' | 'YYYY-MM-DDtoYYYY-MM-DD'
    country=None,                # two-letter country code to focus results
    output_schema=None,          # JSON schema for research structured output
    guidance=None,               # None = default instructions, '' = none, str = custom
    timeout_ms=600_000,          # per-request timeout for the default client
    client=None,                 # YouClient -- None builds youdotcom.You from YDC_API_KEY
)
```
`include_domains` is an allowlist, and cannot be combined with
`exclude_domains` or `boost_domains`. Combining them raises an error when you
create the capability, as do out-of-range limits and an invalid `freshness`.
The domain, `freshness`, and `country` settings apply to `web_search`, `answer`
and `research`. `finance_research` takes only its input and `finance_effort`.

Two instances of the same capability register the same tool names, which is an
error. To run more than one setup in a single agent — say one `YouSearch` over
the open web and one limited to a few domains — wrap the extra ones in core’s
`PrefixTools` capability. It puts a prefix in front of their tool names:

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import PrefixTools
from pydantic_ai_harness import YouSearch
agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6',
    capabilities=[
        YouSearch(),  # web_search, get_page
        PrefixTools(
            wrapped=YouSearch(include_domains=['sec.gov'], guidance=''),
            prefix='sec',
        ),  # sec_web_search, sec_get_page
    ],
)
```
Set `guidance=''` on the wrapped instance (or replace it with text that tells
the model when to use the prefixed tools), since each instance otherwise
contributes the same default research guidance.

The default client is `youdotcom.You`, built from the `YDC_API_KEY`
environment variable. When that variable is not set, creating the capability
fails with a message telling you how to fix it. To set the API key yourself,
point at a different host, or use a fake in tests, pass any object with the
methods listed in the `YouClient` protocol:

```
from youdotcom import You
from pydantic_ai_harness import YouSearch
YouSearch(client=You(api_key_auth='...'))
```
Core ships a [`WebSearch`](/docs/ai/capabilities/overview/#provider-adaptive-tools)
capability that adapts to the model: it uses the provider’s own search where
the model has one, and a local DuckDuckGo tool everywhere else. Use it when you
want search that follows whichever model you run. Use `YouSearch` when you want
the same search on every model: one vendor, excerpts with every result, page
reads you ask for, domain filters, and freshness controls.

Give an agent one web search capability: core `WebSearch`, harness
`ExaSearch`, or `YouSearch`. They all name their tools the same way —
`web_search`, plus `get_page` for the two harness ones — and an agent cannot
have two tools with the same name, so it fails when you create it. If you want
two of them anyway, wrap one in `PrefixTools` to rename its tools, as shown in
[Multiple instances](#multiple-instances). There is one extra case: on
Anthropic models the built-in search is also called `web_search`, so
`WebSearch` clashes there even though the search runs on Anthropic’s side. Pass
`WebSearch(native=False)` to switch it to the DuckDuckGo tool, which is called
`duckduckgo_search` and does not clash.

`YouSearch` and `YouResearch` work with Pydantic AI’s
[agent spec](/docs/ai/core-concepts/agent-spec/), so you can declare them in a
config file instead of Python:

```
# agent.yaml
model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6
capabilities:
  - YouSearch:
      num_results: 5
      freshness: month
  - YouResearch:
      research_effort: deep
```
```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import YouResearch, YouSearch
agent = Agent.from_file('agent.yaml', custom_capability_types=[YouSearch, YouResearch])
```
Pass `custom_capability_types` so the spec loader knows how to instantiate the
capabilities. The `client` field is not spec-serializable; spec-loaded
instances always build the default client from `YDC_API_KEY`. In specs,
`output_schema` takes the JSON-schema dict form.

**Bases:** `AbstractCapability[AgentDepsT]`

Web research for agents, backed by the [You.com](https://you.com) search API.

Adds two tools: `web_search`, which returns search results with
query-relevant excerpts (or full page markdown, with
`extraction_mode='full_page'`), and `get_page`, which retrieves the
markdown of a specific URL.

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness.youdotcom import YouSearch
agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', capabilities=[YouSearch()])
```
Authentication comes from the `YDC_API_KEY` environment variable by
default; pass `client` to configure it explicitly.

Number of results `web_search` returns per query (1 to 20).

**Type:** `int`**Default:** `10`

How `web_search` attaches page content.

`'highlights'` (the default) returns query-relevant excerpts per result,
which keeps surveying several sources cheap. `'full_page'` returns each
result’s full markdown, capped at `max_text_chars`.

**Type:** `ExtractionModeName` **Default:** `'highlights'`

Maximum characters of page text `get_page` and full-page `web_search` return.

**Type:** `int`**Default:** `10000`

If non-empty, results only come from these domains (allowlist).

Mutually exclusive with `exclude_domains` and `boost_domains`; the You.com
API rejects combining an allowlist with either.

**Type:** [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-list)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str)] **Default:** `field(default_factory=(list[str]))`

Results never come from these domains (denylist).

**Type:** [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-list)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str)] **Default:** `field(default_factory=(list[str]))`

Results from these domains are re-ranked higher without excluding others.

**Type:** [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-list)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str)] **Default:** `field(default_factory=(list[str]))`

Restrict results by recency: `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`, or a `YYYY-MM-DDtoYYYY-MM-DD` range.

**Type:** [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str) | `None`**Default:** `None`

Two-letter country code that focuses results geographically.

**Type:** [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str) | `None`**Default:** `None`

Custom research guidance for the system prompt.

Leave as `None` for the default guidance, or set `''` to contribute no
instructions at all.

**Type:** [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str) | `None`**Default:** `None`

Per-request timeout for the default client, in milliseconds. Ignored when `client` is set.

**Type:** `int`**Default:** `DEFAULT_SEARCH_TIMEOUT_MS`

You.com client to use; when `None`, a `youdotcom.You` is built from `YDC_API_KEY`.

Any object satisfying the `YouClient` protocol works: use it to pass an API
key explicitly, point at a different host, or substitute a fake in tests.

**Type:** `YouClient` | `None`**Default:** `None`

```
def __post_init__() -> None
```
Validate configuration against the You.com API’s documented bounds.

```
def get_instructions() -> AgentInstructions[AgentDepsT] | None
```
Static research guidance: search wide, read the promising pages in full, cite URLs.

A non-`None` `guidance` replaces the default; `''` disables instructions
entirely.

`AgentInstructions`[`AgentDepsT`] | `None`

```
def get_toolset() -> YouSearchToolset[AgentDepsT]
```
Build the toolset providing `web_search` and `get_page`.

`YouSearchToolset`[`AgentDepsT`]

`@classmethod`

```
def from_spec(
    cls,
    *,
    num_results: int = 10,
    extraction_mode: ExtractionModeName = 'highlights',
    max_text_chars: int = 10000,
    include_domains: list[str] | None = None,
    exclude_domains: list[str] | None = None,
    boost_domains: list[str] | None = None,
    freshness: str | None = None,
    country: str | None = None,
    guidance: str | None = None,
    timeout_ms: int = DEFAULT_SEARCH_TIMEOUT_MS,
) -> YouSearch[AgentDepsT]
```
Construct the capability from serializable spec options.

The `client` field is not spec-serializable, so spec-loaded instances
always build the default `youdotcom.You` from `YDC_API_KEY`.

`YouSearch`[`AgentDepsT`]

**Bases:** `AbstractCapability[AgentDepsT]`

Cited answers and multi-step research, backed by the [You.com](https://you.com) APIs.

Adds three tools: `answer` (a synthesized answer with citations in one
call), `research` (multi-step research that reads across many sources), and
`finance_research` (the finance-tuned counterpart).

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness.youdotcom import YouResearch
agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', capabilities=[YouResearch()])
```
Authentication comes from the `YDC_API_KEY` environment variable by
default; pass `client` to configure it explicitly.

How hard `research` works: `lite`, `standard`, `deep`, or `exhaustive`.

Higher levels run more searches and take longer. `frontier`, which the API
only runs in background mode, is not supported by this capability.

**Type:** `ResearchEffortName` **Default:** `'standard'`

How hard `finance_research` works: `deep` or `exhaustive`.

**Type:** `FinanceEffortName` **Default:** `'deep'`

If non-empty, `answer` and `research` only draw from these domains (allowlist).

Mutually exclusive with `exclude_domains` and `boost_domains`.

**Type:** [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-list)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str)] **Default:** `field(default_factory=(list[str]))`

`answer` and `research` never draw from these domains (denylist).

**Type:** [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-list)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str)] **Default:** `field(default_factory=(list[str]))`

Results from these domains are re-ranked higher for `answer` and `research`.

**Type:** [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-list)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str)] **Default:** `field(default_factory=(list[str]))`

Restrict `answer` and `research` by recency: `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`, or a range.

**Type:** [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str) | `None`**Default:** `None`

Two-letter country code that focuses `answer` and `research` geographically.

**Type:** [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str) | `None`**Default:** `None`

JSON schema for `research` structured output. `None` returns prose.

The You.com API rejects an `output_schema` with `research_effort='lite'`,
so that combination raises at construction.

**Type:** [`Mapping`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Mapping)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str), [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-object)] | `None`**Default:** `None`

Custom guidance for the system prompt. `None` uses the default; `''` contributes none.

**Type:** [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str) | `None`**Default:** `None`

Per-request timeout for the default client, in milliseconds. Ignored when `client` is set.

**Type:** `int`**Default:** `DEFAULT_RESEARCH_TIMEOUT_MS`

You.com client to use; when `None`, a `youdotcom.You` is built from `YDC_API_KEY`.

**Type:** `YouClient` | `None`**Default:** `None`

```
def __post_init__() -> None
```
Validate configuration against the You.com API’s documented constraints.

```
def get_instructions() -> AgentInstructions[AgentDepsT] | None
```
Static guidance on when to reach for `answer`, `research`, and `finance_research`.

`AgentInstructions`[`AgentDepsT`] | `None`

```
def get_toolset() -> YouResearchToolset[AgentDepsT]
```
Build the toolset providing `answer`, `research`, and `finance_research`.

`YouResearchToolset`[`AgentDepsT`]

`@classmethod`

```
def from_spec(
    cls,
    *,
    research_effort: ResearchEffortName = 'standard',
    finance_effort: FinanceEffortName = 'deep',
    include_domains: list[str] | None = None,
    exclude_domains: list[str] | None = None,
    boost_domains: list[str] | None = None,
    freshness: str | None = None,
    country: str | None = None,
    output_schema: Mapping[str, object] | None = None,
    guidance: str | None = None,
    timeout_ms: int = DEFAULT_RESEARCH_TIMEOUT_MS,
) -> YouResearch[AgentDepsT]
```
Construct the capability from serializable spec options.

The `client` field is not spec-serializable, so spec-loaded instances
always build the default `youdotcom.You` from `YDC_API_KEY`.

`YouResearch`[`AgentDepsT`]

**Bases:** `FunctionToolset[AgentDepsT]`

Gives an agent web research tools backed by the You.com Search and Contents APIs.

`web_search` surveys the web and returns results with query-relevant
excerpts (or full page markdown, with `extraction_mode='full_page'`), and
`get_page` retrieves the markdown of one specific URL.

Each tool returns a `ToolReturn` whose `return_value` is the text the model
sees and whose `metadata['sources']` lists the result URLs and titles
(`YouSource` dicts), so applications can render citations from
`ToolReturnPart.metadata` without parsing the text. `web_search` also
carries the response `search_uuid` and `latency` in metadata for tracing.

`get_page` and full-page `web_search` text are capped at `max_text_chars`
characters. Bounds are validated by `YouSearch` at construction.

`@async`

```
def web_search(query: str) -> ToolReturn[str]
```
Search the web and return matching pages, each with its most relevant excerpts.

[`ToolReturn`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/messages/#pydantic_ai.messages.ToolReturn)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str)] — The matching pages, each with title, URL, and excerpts.

**`query`** : `str`

The search query. Natural-language questions and keyword queries both work.

`@async`

```
def get_page(url: str) -> ToolReturn[str]
```
Retrieve the markdown of a specific URL.

Use it to read a promising URL from `web_search` results in full, or a
URL the user provided.

[`ToolReturn`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/messages/#pydantic_ai.messages.ToolReturn)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str)] — The page’s title, URL, and markdown content.

**`url`** : `str`

The URL of the page to read.

**Bases:** `FunctionToolset[AgentDepsT]`

Provides `answer`, `research`, and `finance_research` backed by the You.com APIs.

Each tool returns a `ToolReturn` whose `return_value` is the synthesized,
cited answer the model sees, with a `Sources:` block appended, and whose
`metadata['sources']` lists the sources as `YouSource` dicts.

`research` runs as a blocking call bounded by `timeout_ms`. It supports the
`lite`, `standard`, `deep`, and `exhaustive` effort levels; `frontier`,
which the API only runs in background mode, is not supported here.

`@async`

```
def answer(query: str) -> ToolReturn[str]
```
Get a synthesized answer with citations, grounded in live web results.

[`ToolReturn`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/messages/#pydantic_ai.messages.ToolReturn)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str)] — A cited answer, followed by the sources it drew on.

**`query`** : `str`

The question to answer.

`@async`

```
def research(input: str) -> ToolReturn[str]
```
Run multi-step research and return a thorough, cited answer.

Suited to questions too complex for a single lookup: it runs many searches, reads the sources, and synthesizes a verifiable answer.

[`ToolReturn`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/messages/#pydantic_ai.messages.ToolReturn)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str)] — The synthesized answer, followed by the sources it drew on.

**`input`** : `str`

The research question or complex query.

`@async`

```
def finance_research(input: str) -> ToolReturn[str]
```
Run finance-tuned research on companies, markets, and instruments.

[`ToolReturn`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/messages/#pydantic_ai.messages.ToolReturn)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str)] — The synthesized analysis, followed by the sources it drew on.

**`input`** : `str`

The finance research question.

**Bases:** `TypedDict`

One source behind a tool result, carried in `ToolReturn.metadata['sources']`.
