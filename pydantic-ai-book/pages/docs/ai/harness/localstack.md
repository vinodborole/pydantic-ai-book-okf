# LocalStack

`LocalStack` gives an agent access to an emulated AWS environment, so it can
provision and exercise AWS services without touching a real account. It wires
the AWS CLI to a running [LocalStack](https://www.localstack.cloud/) instance —
injecting the endpoint, region, and credentials — and can optionally start and
stop the LocalStack Docker container for each run.

While Pydantic AI Harness is on 0.x releases, the API may change between minor releases; when it does, deprecation warnings and release-note migration guidance tell you (or your agent) exactly how to upgrade. See the [version policy](/docs/ai/harness/#version-policy).

Agents that build or test cloud infrastructure need somewhere to create buckets, tables, queues, and functions. Pointing them at real AWS is slow, costs money, risks leaking credentials, and is hard to reset between runs. LocalStack emulates the AWS APIs locally, but wiring an agent to it means repeating the same boilerplate: injecting the endpoint URL, supplying dummy credentials, shelling out to the AWS CLI, and checking which services are up.

`LocalStack` exposes AWS tooling wired to a running LocalStack instance. The
agent issues plain AWS CLI commands; the capability injects the endpoint, region,
and credentials, and adds a health check for the emulated services.

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import LocalStack
agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6',
    capabilities=[LocalStack()],
)
result = agent.run_sync('Create an S3 bucket called reports and list all buckets.')
print(result.output)
```
By default the agent connects to a LocalStack instance you started separately —
for example with the
[`localstack` CLI](https://docs.localstack.cloud/aws/tooling/localstack-cli/)
(`localstack start`). The defaults match LocalStack’s conventions: the edge
endpoint `http://localhost.localstack.cloud:4566` (which resolves to
`127.0.0.1`) and `test` / `test` credentials. Set `manage_container=True` to have
the capability start and stop a fresh Docker container per run.

| Tool | Purpose | 
|---|---|
| `aws_cli` | Run an AWS CLI command against LocalStack. Pass the command **without** the leading`aws` and**without**`--endpoint-url` — both are injected. Returns labelled stdout/stderr plus an exit code on failure. | 
| `localstack_health` | Query LocalStack’s health endpoint and return the JSON of which services (s3, dynamodb, sqs, etc.) are available. | 

Commands run as an argument vector (no shell), so shell operators and
redirection in the command string have no effect. Output is labelled with
`[stdout]` / `[stderr]` markers and an `[exit code: N]` line on non-zero exit.
When it exceeds `max_output_chars` the **tail** is kept (the head is dropped),
so errors survive truncation.

The AWS CLI can read from and write to local files through arguments such as
`--body`, `file://`, `fileb://`, and `s3 cp`. Treat this capability as both
AWS-emulator access and AWS CLI access to the process’s filesystem.

| Field | Effect | 
|---|---|
| `allowed_services` | If non-empty, only these AWS services may be used (allowlist), e.g. `['s3', 'dynamodb']` . | 
| `denied_services` | These AWS services are always rejected (denylist). | 

`allowed_services` and `denied_services` are mutually exclusive — set one, not
both. The service is the first non-flag token of the command (`s3` in `s3 ls`).

Set `manage_container=True` and the capability starts a LocalStack Docker
container for each run and stops it when the run ends, so the agent always gets a
fresh, isolated environment. Docker must be installed and running.

```
from pydantic_ai_harness import LocalStack
LocalStack(
    manage_container=True,
    image='localstack/localstack',
    container_env={'DEBUG': '1', 'PERSISTENCE': '1'},
    startup_timeout=120.0,
)
```
The container’s edge port (`4566`) is published on the host port from
`endpoint_url`, and the capability waits for the health endpoint before the run
starts, then stops the container when it ends (even if the run raises). Each run
gets its own container, so concurrent runs of one agent need distinct host ports
or an externally managed instance (`manage_container=False`).

Since LocalStack 2026.03.0 the default `localstack/localstack` image is a single
image that requires an auth token to start (a free Hobby/OSS token covers
community usage). When `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN` is set in the current process it
is forwarded to the container automatically; a legacy `LOCALSTACK_API_KEY` value
is forwarded when no auth token is set. Auth values are forwarded through the
Docker CLI environment rather than embedded in the `docker run` arguments. The
default `localstack/localstack` image requires a token to start, so a managed run
needs one configured. To run tokenless, set `image` to a tag from before the
account requirement, such as a `localstack/localstack:4.x` release.

Docker-backed services such as Lambda need the Docker socket mounted, and some
services expose ports outside the gateway (LocalStack reserves `4510-4559`).
Enable those explicitly when a service you test requires them:

```
from pydantic_ai_harness import LocalStack
LocalStack(manage_container=True, service_port_range='4510-4559', mount_docker_socket=True)
```
Mounting the Docker socket gives the container host-level Docker control. Keep
`mount_docker_socket=False` unless the emulated service requires it and the run
environment is already trusted.

The same lifecycle is available standalone as an async context manager:

```
import asyncio
from pydantic_ai_harness.localstack import LocalStackContainer
async def main() -> None:
    async with LocalStackContainer(environment={'DEBUG': '1'}) as localstack:
        ...  # talk to localstack.endpoint_url
asyncio.run(main())
```
```
from pydantic_ai_harness import LocalStack
LocalStack(
    endpoint_url='http://localhost.localstack.cloud:4566',  # edge endpoint (host port reused when managed)
    region='us-east-1',                    # region for the CLI and environment
    access_key_id='test',                  # LocalStack accepts any value
    secret_access_key='test',              # LocalStack accepts any value
    allowed_services=[],                   # allowlist (mutually exclusive with denied)
    denied_services=[],                    # denylist
    default_timeout=60.0,                  # seconds, per command and health check
    max_output_chars=50_000,               # output cap returned to the model
    aws_cli_path='aws',                    # CLI executable (e.g. 'aws' or 'awslocal')
    manage_container=False,                # start/stop a Docker container per run
    image='localstack/localstack',         # image used when managing the container
    host_address='127.0.0.1',              # host address for Docker port publishing
    service_port_range=None,               # e.g. '4510-4559' for non-gateway service ports
    mount_docker_socket=False,             # required by Docker-backed services such as Lambda
    container_name=None,                   # optional name for the managed container
    container_env={},                      # env vars for the managed container
    docker_path='docker',                  # Docker executable
    startup_timeout=120.0,                 # seconds to wait for the container to be ready
    include_instructions=True,             # add usage instructions to the prompt
)
```
The AWS CLI must be installed and on `PATH` (or point `aws_cli_path` at it). If
the binary is missing, `aws_cli` returns a clear error instead of aborting the
run. Set `include_instructions=False` to omit the capability’s prompt text when
you supply your own.

`LocalStack` works with Pydantic AI’s
[agent spec](/docs/ai/core-concepts/agent-spec/):

```
# agent.yaml
model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6
capabilities:
  - LocalStack:
      endpoint_url: http://localhost.localstack.cloud:4566
      allowed_services: ['s3', 'dynamodb', 'sqs']
```
```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import LocalStack
agent = Agent.from_file('agent.yaml', custom_capability_types=[LocalStack])
```
Pass `custom_capability_types` so the spec loader knows how to instantiate
`LocalStack`.

**Bases:** `AbstractCapability[AgentDepsT]`

Access to an emulated AWS environment via LocalStack.

Gives the agent AWS CLI tooling wired to a running LocalStack instance, so it
can provision and interact with AWS services (S3, DynamoDB, SQS, Lambda, …)
without touching real AWS. Start LocalStack separately (`localstack start` or
its Docker image) before running the agent.

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness.localstack import LocalStack
agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', capabilities=[LocalStack()])
result = agent.run_sync('Create an S3 bucket called reports and list all buckets.')
print(result.output)
```
AWS access key id. LocalStack accepts any value; defaults to its `test` convention.

**Type:** `str`**Default:** `'test'`

If non-empty, only these AWS services may be used (allowlist), e.g. `['s3', 'dynamodb']`.

**Type:** [`Sequence`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Sequence)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)] **Default:** `field(default_factory=(list[str]))`

Path or name of the AWS CLI executable (e.g. `aws` or `awslocal`).

**Type:** `str`**Default:** `'aws'`

**Type:** [`Mapping`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Mapping)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str), [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)] **Default:** `field(default_factory=(dict[str, str]))`

Optional name for the managed container. Leave None to let Docker assign one.

**Type:** [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) | `None`**Default:** `None`

Default timeout in seconds for AWS CLI commands and the health check.

**Type:** `float`**Default:** `60.0`

These AWS services are always rejected (denylist).

**Type:** [`Sequence`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Sequence)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)] **Default:** `field(default_factory=(list[str]))`

Path or name of the Docker executable used to manage the container.

**Type:** `str`**Default:** `'docker'`

Base URL of the running LocalStack instance.

Defaults to LocalStack’s `localhost.localstack.cloud` domain (which resolves to
`127.0.0.1`) for compatibility with AWS SDKs that need subdomain-style hosts.

**Type:** `str`**Default:** `'http://localhost.localstack.cloud:4566'`

Host address Docker publishes the LocalStack edge port on.

**Type:** `str`**Default:** `'127.0.0.1'`

Docker image to run when `manage_container` is True.

**Type:** `str`**Default:** `'localstack/localstack'`

If True, add instructions telling the model how to use the emulated environment.

**Type:** `bool`**Default:** `True`

If True, start a LocalStack Docker container for each run and stop it when the run ends.

Requires Docker. When False (default), the agent connects to a LocalStack
instance you started separately at `endpoint_url`.

**Type:** `bool`**Default:** `False`

Maximum characters of output returned to the model. Must be positive.

**Type:** `int`**Default:** `50000`

If True, mount `/var/run/docker.sock` into the managed container for Docker-backed services like Lambda.

**Type:** `bool`**Default:** `False`

AWS region passed to the CLI and exported to the environment.

**Type:** `str`**Default:** `'us-east-1'`

AWS secret access key. LocalStack accepts any value; defaults to its `test` convention.

**Type:** `str`**Default:** `'test'`

Optional host/container port range for services that expose their own ports, e.g. `4510-4559`.

**Type:** [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) | `None`**Default:** `None`

Seconds to wait for the managed container to become ready before failing.

**Type:** `float`**Default:** `120.0`

```
def get_instructions() -> str | None
```
Explain the emulated environment to the model, unless disabled.

```
def get_toolset() -> AgentToolset[AgentDepsT]
```
Build and return the LocalStack toolset.

[`AgentToolset`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/toolsets/#pydantic_ai.toolsets.AgentToolset)[`AgentDepsT`]

**Bases:** `FunctionToolset[AgentDepsT]`

Gives an agent the ability to drive an emulated AWS environment.

Wraps the AWS CLI: `aws_cli` runs a command against a running LocalStack
instance with the endpoint, region, and credentials injected, while
`localstack_health` reports which emulated services are available.

Commands are executed as an argument vector (no shell), so shell operators and redirection in the command string have no effect.

`@async`

```
def __aenter__() -> Self
```
Start the managed LocalStack container, if configured, before tools run.

`@async`

```
def __aexit__(*args: object) -> None
```
Stop the managed LocalStack container, if one was started.

`@async`

```
def aws_cli(command: str, *, timeout_seconds: float | None = None) -> str
```
Run an AWS CLI command against the emulated AWS environment.

Pass the command without the leading `aws` and without `--endpoint-url`;
the endpoint, region, and credentials are injected automatically. For
example `s3 mb s3://my-bucket`, `s3 ls`, or `dynamodb list-tables`.

[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) — Labelled stdout/stderr output, with an exit code on non-zero exit.

**`command`** : `str`

The AWS CLI command to run (e.g. `s3 ls`).

Maximum seconds to wait (default: the configured timeout).

`@async`

```
def call_tool(
    name: str,
    tool_args: dict[str, Any],
    ctx: RunContext[AgentDepsT],
    tool: ToolsetTool[AgentDepsT],
) -> Any
```
Enforce the model-visible output cap at the tool dispatch seam.

Only `str` results are capped; a future tool returning rich content
(e.g. `ToolReturn`) needs this seam extended.

`@async`

```
def for_run(ctx: RunContext[AgentDepsT]) -> AbstractToolset[AgentDepsT]
```
Return a fresh instance per run so a managed container is isolated and torn down.

`get_toolset` builds one shared instance at agent construction. When this
toolset manages a Docker container it holds per-run lifecycle state, so each
run gets its own instance (and its own container) that `__aexit__` can stop.

[`AbstractToolset`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/toolsets/#pydantic_ai.toolsets.AbstractToolset)[`AgentDepsT`]

`@async`

```
def localstack_health() -> str
```
Report the health and availability of the emulated AWS services.

Queries LocalStack’s health endpoint and returns the raw JSON, which maps each service (s3, dynamodb, sqs, …) to its state (available, running, …).

[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) — The health JSON, or an error message if LocalStack is unreachable.

Async context manager that starts and stops a LocalStack Docker container.

Drives the `docker` CLI, so Docker must be installed and running. On enter it
launches the container, polls the health endpoint until LocalStack is ready,
and exposes `endpoint_url`. On exit it stops the container — it is started
with `--rm`, so stopping also removes it.

```
async with LocalStackContainer() as localstack:
    ...  # talk to localstack.endpoint_url
```
The running container’s id, or None when it is not running.

URL of the container’s edge endpoint.

For the default loopback publish addresses (`127.0.0.1` and the
bind-all `0.0.0.0`, both reachable at `127.0.0.1`), uses LocalStack’s
`localhost.localstack.cloud` domain, which resolves to `127.0.0.1` and
supports the subdomain-style hosts some AWS SDKs need. For any other
`host_address`, uses that address literally, since
`localhost.localstack.cloud` does not resolve there.

**Type:** `str`

`@async`

```
def __aenter__() -> Self
```
Start the container and wait for it to become ready.

`@async`

```
def __aexit__(*args: object) -> None
```
Stop and remove the container.
