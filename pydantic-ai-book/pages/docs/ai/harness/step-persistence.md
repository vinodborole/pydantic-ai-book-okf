# Step Persistence

`StepPersistence` records what an agent did at each boundary, separate from whether the run can be safely resumed. It is the persistence substrate for orchestrators that delegate to sub-agents — for example, an AICA orchestrator that spawns a `code_librarian` to investigate one symbol, then continues that delegate’s investigation with a follow-up question.

It is not a full graph-state checkpoint. Capability-state restore, workspace snapshots, and graph-node resume are out of scope and tracked separately (see `pydantic-ai-harness` issues #149 and #196).

The API may change between releases. Where practical, breaking changes ship with a deprecation warning.

1. **Append-only step events.** Every interesting boundary (run start/end, model request, tool call, failure) appends a`StepEvent` . A run killed mid-tool-call still leaves a usable event trail.
2. **Continuable snapshots.** A`ContinuableSnapshot` is saved at settled node boundaries, and a failing run saves its live at-failure history. Each snapshot carries a`state` :`complete` when every`ToolCallPart` has a matching result,`interrupted` when the capture holds unsettled tool work (e.g. a crash mid-tool-cycle).`latest_snapshot` and`continue_run` return only`complete` snapshots unless the caller passes`include_interrupted=True` . Pass the snapshot’s`messages` back to`Agent.run(message_history=...)` to continue or fork.
3. **Tool-effect ledger.** Every tool call’s lifecycle (`started` ,`completed` ,`failed` ) is recorded against`(run_id, tool_call_id)` . After a crash, a tool with a`started` record and no terminal update should be treated as`unknown_after_crash` : the side effect may or may not have happened.
4. **Lineage metadata.**`conversation_id` (sequence) and`parent_run_id` (hierarchy) are independent axes. See[Three-level identity](#three-level-identity) .

```
import asyncio
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import StepPersistence, InMemoryStepStore
store = InMemoryStepStore()
librarian = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    capabilities=[StepPersistence(store=store, agent_name='code_librarian')],
)
async def main():
    await librarian.run('Find ThinkingPartDelta and confirm the callable allowance')
asyncio.run(main())
```
That is the whole setup. `run_id` is always per-`Agent.run` call, matching pydantic_ai’s `RunContext.run_id`. For multi-turn logical grouping use `conversation_id=` — that is the pydantic_ai-native primitive for it (see [Three-level identity](#three-level-identity)).

`run_id` resolution per call:

- **Explicit `run_id='libr-1'`** becomes the id for this one call. This suits single-shot use cases (a deterministic id for testing, replay, debugging, or a one-off scripted run). Reusing one capability instance with the same explicit`run_id` across multiple`.run()` calls raises`ValueError` in`before_run` . The tool-effect ledger is keyed by`(run_id, tool_call_id)` and providers reuse deterministic tool-call ids, so a silent collision would erase the`unknown_after_crash` signal. Use`conversation_id=` for multi-turn grouping instead.
- **`agent_name` set, `run_id` unset** derives`'{agent_name}-{8-char-hex}'` , freshly materialised in`for_run` per`.run()` call. Reusing one capability instance across runs yields distinct ids (`code_librarian-a3b2` ,`code_librarian-c9d1` , and so on). This is the recommended default for delegate capabilities.
- **Neither set** falls back to`ctx.run_id` (pydantic_ai’s auto-generated id) per`.run()` call, and to a UUID4 if that is absent.

The orchestrator pattern — one logical agent serving many turns — uses `conversation_id`, not a shared `run_id`:

```
import asyncio
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import StepPersistence, InMemoryStepStore
store = InMemoryStepStore()
orchestrator = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    capabilities=[StepPersistence(store=store, agent_name='orchestrator')],
)
async def main():
    for turn in turns:
        await orchestrator.run(turn, conversation_id='orch-conv')
    # All turns of this orchestrator, chronological:
    records = await store.list_runs(conversation_id='orch-conv')
asyncio.run(main())
```
The capability mirrors pydantic_ai’s identity stack:

| Concept | Definition | Granularity | 
|---|---|---|
| `conversation_id` | The dialogue. Resolved by pydantic_ai from the `conversation_id=` argument to`Agent.run` , or the most recent`conversation_id` on`message_history` , or a fresh UUID7. | sequence of runs | 
| `run_id` | One `Agent.run` invocation. | one step in the sequence | 
| `step_index` | Graph-node count within a run ( `ctx.run_step` ). | one node within one run | 

`StepEvent.conversation_id` and `RunRecord.conversation_id` are populated from `ctx.conversation_id`. So three `.run()` calls sharing one `conversation_id` produce three distinct `run_id`s, all queryable as a group:

```
import asyncio
async def main():
    runs = await store.list_runs(conversation_id='conv-abc')  # 3 records, chronological
asyncio.run(main())
```
pydantic_ai already has `message_history=` for “carry on with this prior context”. `StepPersistence` does not introduce a parallel mechanism. It exposes one helper that loads the most recent settled snapshot:

```
import asyncio
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import (
    StepPersistence,
    InMemoryStepStore,
    continue_run,
)
store = InMemoryStepStore()
librarian = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    capabilities=[StepPersistence(store=store, agent_name='code_librarian')],
)
async def main():
    # Earlier: tag the first turn with a conversation id so the follow-up can find it.
    await librarian.run(
        'Find ThinkingPartDelta and confirm the callable allowance',
        conversation_id='libr-conv',
    )
    # Later (possibly a different process):
    prior_run = (await store.list_runs(conversation_id='libr-conv'))[-1].run_id
    history = await continue_run(store, run_id=prior_run)
    await librarian.run(
        'Read _apply_provider_details_delta and check the path',
        message_history=history,
        conversation_id='libr-conv',   # keep the conversation grouping
    )
asyncio.run(main())
```
`fork_run(store, run_id=...)` returns the same shape but is intended when the caller wants a branched logical run from that snapshot point (the new run gets a fresh `run_id` and probably a fresh `conversation_id`).

By default `continue_run` returns the messages of the latest `complete` snapshot for that `run_id` — a point whose tool work was fully settled when captured. Snapshots are written at these boundaries:

- after every `CallToolsNode` whose tool calls all returned — the pending tool-return request is folded in, so the point is durable the moment the tool completes, before the next model request is even sent,
- at `after_run` , when the run ended past that boundary (a run that reached no boundary at all, or an`Agent.run_stream` whose closing response lands after the last one), and
- when a run *fails* : the live history at failure time is saved, whatever its shape — a model request that raises after a clean tool cycle produces a`complete` snapshot; a crash mid-tool-cycle produces an`interrupted` one carrying every completed cycle.

An `interrupted` snapshot is sendable on resume — pydantic-ai (>= 2.10) repairs broken tool-call/result pairing before every model request — but not necessarily *safe*: a pending tool call may be re-executed (resuming without a new prompt) or closed out with a synthesized `interrupted` return, and neither says whether the original side effect happened. That is the tool-effect ledger’s job. So the default read path skips `interrupted` snapshots; pass `include_interrupted=True` to `continue_run` / `fork_run` / `latest_snapshot` after checking `list_unresolved_tool_effects`. If no matching snapshot exists, `continue_run` raises `LookupError`.

`parent_run_id` is a lineage label, not a functional dependency. It does two things:

- Every `StepEvent` and`RunRecord` carries it, so you can filter and group.
- `store.list_runs(parent_run_id='orch-1')` returns every delegate run pointing at that orchestrator.

It is auto-inferred for in-process delegation: when an orchestrator’s tool synchronously calls a delegate’s `Agent.run(...)`, the delegate’s `StepPersistence` picks up the orchestrator’s `run_id` via a `ContextVar` that the orchestrator’s `wrap_run` set. No threading required:

```
import asyncio
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import StepPersistence, InMemoryStepStore
store = InMemoryStepStore()
orchestrator = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    capabilities=[StepPersistence(store=store, agent_name='orchestrator')],
)
librarian = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    capabilities=[StepPersistence(store=store, agent_name='code_librarian')],
)
@orchestrator.tool_plain
async def ask_librarian(question: str) -> str:
    result = await librarian.run(question)   # parent_run_id auto-filled
    return result.output
async def main():
    # Tag the orchestrator turn so the lookup below can find its run_id.
    await orchestrator.run(
        'Where is ThinkingPartDelta defined?',
        conversation_id='orch-conv',
    )
    # All librarian runs now point at the orchestrator's run_id:
    orch_run_id = (await store.list_runs(conversation_id='orch-conv'))[-1].run_id
    delegates = await store.list_runs(parent_run_id=orch_run_id)
asyncio.run(main())
```
Set `parent_run_id=` explicitly to override (for example, cross-process delegation where `ContextVar`s do not propagate).

`parent_run_id` is distinct from `conversation_id`. The orchestrator and delegate usually live in different conversations (the orchestrator talks to a user; the delegate talks to itself). But they share a parent-child link.

`list_runs` returns matches sorted by `started_at` ascending across all backends — pick the most recent with `[-1]`.

```
import asyncio
async def main():
    # Every delegate of one orchestrator run (chronological)
    delegates = await store.list_runs(parent_run_id='orch-3f2a')
    # Every run in one dialogue (multi-turn conversation across many .run() calls)
    turns = await store.list_runs(conversation_id='conv-abc')
    latest_turn = turns[-1]
    # Filters combine (AND):
    focused = await store.list_runs(
        parent_run_id='orch-3f2a',
        conversation_id='libr-conv',
    )
    # Detail per run:
    events = await store.list_events(run_id=delegates[0].run_id)
    snapshot = await store.latest_snapshot(run_id=delegates[0].run_id)
    unresolved = await store.list_unresolved_tool_effects(run_id=delegates[0].run_id)
asyncio.run(main())
```
```
import asyncio
async def main():
    # An earlier delegate run died mid-investigation.
    events = await store.list_events(run_id='libr-3f2a')
    unresolved = await store.list_unresolved_tool_effects(run_id='libr-3f2a')
    for record in unresolved:
        # status == 'started' with no terminal update -- unknown_after_crash.
        print(f'tool {record.tool_name} ({record.tool_call_id}) may or may not have run')
        print(f'  idempotency_key={record.idempotency_key}  '
              f'effect_summary={record.effect_summary}')
    # Decide whether to resume or branch:
    history = await continue_run(store, run_id='libr-3f2a')
    # If the unresolved tools were read-only and safe to redo:
    await librarian.run('continue investigating', message_history=history,
                        conversation_id='libr-conv')
    # If side effects might have happened and the orchestrator wants a fresh attempt:
    history = await fork_run(store, run_id='libr-3f2a')
    # ... pass to a new delegate run with a different agent_name / conversation_id.
    # To resume from the interrupted frontier itself (the crashed cycle included),
    # after checking the unresolved effects above:
    history = await continue_run(store, run_id='libr-3f2a', include_interrupted=True)
asyncio.run(main())
```
Side-effect deduplication is the orchestrator’s responsibility. Tools that write external state should annotate their in-flight `ToolEffectRecord` via `annotate_tool_effect`:

```
from pydantic_ai import RunContext
from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import annotate_tool_effect
@orchestrator.tool
async def set_label(ctx: RunContext[Deps], issue: int, label: str) -> str:
    await annotate_tool_effect(
        store,
        ctx,
        idempotency_key=f'issue-{issue}::label::{label}',
        effect_summary=f'set label {label!r} on issue #{issue}',
    )
    await github.set_label(issue, label)   # the actual side effect
    return 'ok'
```
The helper reads the active `run_id` from the `StepPersistence` `ContextVar` and `tool_call_id` / `tool_name` from `ctx`, then merges the metadata into the prior record. It is a no-op when called outside a step-persistence-wrapped tool call. `after_tool_execute` preserves both fields when it writes the terminal `completed` / `failed` entry.

`StepPersistence.compaction_transcript_handle()` exposes the current `run_id` to compaction receipts. It is an identifier for this store’s persisted run history, not a promise that the pre-compaction transcript remains available: snapshots can already contain compacted history and configured retention can delete older snapshots.

- `InMemoryStepStore` — process-local; great for tests.
- `FileStepStore(directory)` — directory layout under`<directory>/<run_id>/` :
  - `run.json` —`RunRecord` (lineage)
  - `events.jsonl` — append-only`StepEvent` s
  - `tool_effects.jsonl` — append-only`ToolEffectRecord` s, scoped to this run
  - `snapshots/{seq}.json` —`ContinuableSnapshot` s, named by a per-run monotonic counter (not`step_index` , which would collide when the same`run_id` is reused across`Agent.run` calls, since`ctx.run_step` resets to 0 each call).
- `SqliteStepStore(database='runs.db')` — single SQLite file with tables`runs` ,`events` ,`snapshots` ,`tool_effects` , and a sibling`media` table for externalized blobs (see[Persisting media](#persisting-media) below). WAL mode is enabled;`tool_effects` upserts per`(run_id, tool_call_id)` so the latest state wins; snapshots use`AUTOINCREMENT seq` to mirror`FileStepStore._next_snapshot_seq` . Databases created before the snapshot`state` column existed gain it automatically on open (existing rows read as`complete` ). Pass`connection=` instead of`database=` to share a`sqlite3.Connection` with the rest of your application; the connection must be opened with`check_same_thread=False` because hook calls are dispatched onto a worker thread.
- `MongoStepStore(client= or db_url=, database=...)` — MongoDB collections`runs` ,`events` ,`snapshots` ,`tool_effects` , and`counters` (atomic`$inc` allocates the monotonic`seq` ).`runs._id = run_id` enforces the single-shot`run_id` contract. Needs the`mongodb` extra (`pip install pydantic-ai-harness[mongodb]` , which installs`pymongo>=4.17.0` ); pass a shared`AsyncMongoClient` as`client=` , or a connection string as`db_url=` (the store then owns the client — call`await store.aclose()` to release it). Individual parts at or above`media_threshold_bytes` externalize by default to a`MongoMediaStore` on the same client. That is a per-value offload, not an aggregate cap: a snapshot of many below-threshold parts can still exceed MongoDB’s 16 MiB document limit and fail on insert, so lower the threshold if that is a risk for your workload.

All implement the same async `StepStore` protocol, so capability hooks never block the event loop on the file/sqlite backends (I/O is dispatched via `anyio.to_thread`); the Mongo backend is natively async.

`FileStepStore` validates `run_id` against `[A-Za-z0-9_.-]{1,200}` (and rejects `..`) to prevent path traversal. Callers passing user-controlled IDs should still sanitise first.

The store issues `createIndex` on its first write, for eight indexes: `conversation_id` and `parent_run_id` (both sparse) plus `started_at` on `runs`; `(run_id, seq)` on `events`; `(run_id, seq)` and `(run_id, state, seq)` on `snapshots`; and a unique `(run_id, tool_call_id)` plus `(run_id, status)` on `tool_effects`. Its default `MongoMediaStore` adds one more, described on the [media page](/docs/ai/harness/media). Three consequences worth knowing before pointing the store at an existing deployment:

- The connecting user needs the privilege to create indexes. A restricted Atlas role without it fails on the first write, not at construction.
- The unique index build fails if an existing `tool_effects` collection already holds duplicate`(run_id, tool_call_id)` pairs.
- Index builds against already-populated collections cost time and I/O on that first call.

`RunRecord.metadata` and `StepEvent.metadata` are stored as nested documents, so their keys become BSON field names: keys containing `.` or starting with “RunRecord.metadata`and`StepEvent.metadata`are stored as nested documents, so their keys become BSON field names: keys containing`.`or starting with  need [MongoDB 5.0 or later](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/dot-dollar-considerations/), and a key containing a NULL byte is rejected by the BSON encoder before it reaches the server. CI exercises both Mongo backends against`mongo:8`.

Each step writes a new full-history snapshot keyed by an incrementing `seq`, and nothing is pruned by default. Within one long `Agent.run` the snapshot count equals the number of settled tool-call steps, so a long single run pays a growing storage cost.

All four stores — `InMemoryStepStore`, `FileStepStore`, `SqliteStepStore`, and `MongoStepStore` — accept an opt-in `max_snapshots_per_run: int | None` (default `None`, unbounded — byte-for-byte the prior behavior). When set to `N >= 1`, each `save_snapshot` prunes the run down to a retain set:

- the newest `N` snapshots by`seq` ,
- the newest snapshot overall (serves `latest_snapshot(include_interrupted=True)` ),
- the newest `complete` snapshot (serves the default read path).

The last two keep both read modes correct even when the newest `N` snapshots are all `interrupted` and the newest resumable `complete` sits below that window, so the retain set can exceed `N`. `from_spec(..., max_snapshots_per_run=N)` forwards the bound to the store it constructs (`backend='memory'`, `'file'`, or `'sqlite'`; a Mongo store is built directly, not from a spec).

```
from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import FileStepStore
store = FileStepStore('runs', max_snapshots_per_run=8)
```
Pruning a snapshot never deletes its externalized media: blobs are content-addressed and may be shared across snapshots and runs, so orphaned-blob GC is out of scope (see the non-goals below). Age-based (TTL) expiry is out of scope too — it belongs at whole-run granularity, not per snapshot.

Bounded retention discards older per-step snapshots, including pre-compaction ones. Any downstream that reconstructs history by unioning a run’s retained snapshots — snapshot search or a compaction receipt keyed on `run_id` — can only see what is retained. With a tight bound (for example `max_snapshots_per_run=1`) the older, pre-compaction states are gone, so treat the bound as a hard limit on how far back such recovery can reach. Leave the bound at `None`, or set it high enough to cover the history you need to recover, when historical reconstruction matters.

`BinaryContent` payloads (images, audio, documents, video) inlined as base64 inside a snapshot would balloon every file or row containing the message; a large text part (e.g. a big tool-return string) does the same and can push a `MongoStepStore` snapshot past MongoDB’s 16 MiB document cap ([#440](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness/issues/440)). The file, sqlite, and mongo backends externalize any `BinaryContent.data`, and any part whose string `content` is at or above **64 KiB**, through a configured `MediaStore`, leaving a URI reference in the snapshot. The same `media_threshold_bytes` governs binary and text alike; there is no separate text knob. Round-trip is transparent: `latest_snapshot(...).messages[*]` returns the original `BinaryContent` bytes and text.

Text externalization is not Mongo-only and has no opt-out short of `media_store=None`: the walker is shared, so an existing `FileStepStore` or `SqliteStepStore` deployment starts writing blobs for large text parts as well as binary ones from this release on. Snapshots written before it still restore — the reader recognises the older binary marker shape. This compatibility is upgrade-only: a release that predates text externalization treats every marker as binary, so it cannot validate a snapshot containing an externalized text marker. Keep a current reader for persisted snapshots that contain those markers.

| StepStore | Default `media_store` | Where blobs live | 
|---|---|---|
| `InMemoryStepStore` | not applicable | bytes stay in the in-memory snapshot | 
| `FileStepStore` | `DiskMediaStore(<root>/media/)` | `<root>/media/<sha256>.bin` | 
| `SqliteStepStore` | `SqliteMediaStore(database=<same db>)` | sibling `media` table in the same DB | 
| `MongoStepStore` | `MongoMediaStore(client=<same client>)` | sibling `media` +`media_chunks` collections | 

Override the destination by passing your own `MediaStore`:

```
from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import FileStepStore
from pydantic_ai_harness.media import S3MediaStore
store = FileStepStore(
    'runs',
    media_store=S3MediaStore(
        bucket='my-bucket',
        endpoint='https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com',
        region='auto',
        access_key_id=...,
        secret_access_key=...,
    ),
    media_threshold_bytes=64 * 1024,  # raise or lower if you want
)
```
Opt out entirely (keep bytes inline in the snapshot JSON/row):

```
from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import FileStepStore, SqliteStepStore
FileStepStore('runs', media_store=None)
SqliteStepStore(database='runs.db', media_store=None)
```
URIs are `media+sha256://<hex>`, content-addressed. The same blob written through any `MediaStore` resolves the same way, so dedup is automatic and moving the underlying storage is a one-line swap. The shipped implementations are:

- `DiskMediaStore(directory)` — one file per blob at`<directory>/<sha256>.bin` .
- `SqliteMediaStore(database=...)` or`SqliteMediaStore(connection=...)` — one row per blob (`INSERT OR IGNORE` for content-addressed dedup).
- `S3MediaStore(bucket=, endpoint=, region=, access_key_id=, secret_access_key=)` — path-style URLs plus handrolled SigV4. Compatible with AWS S3, Cloudflare R2 (`region='auto'` ), MinIO, and other S3-compatible providers. PUT/GET/HEAD only — no multipart, lifecycle, or listing in v1.
- `MongoMediaStore(client= or db_url=, database=...)` — MongoDB, needs the`mongodb` extra. Each blob is sha256-addressed chunks across a`media` manifest document and a sibling`media_chunks` collection (manual chunking rather than GridFS, so dedup is preserved — see the[media page](/docs/ai/harness/media) ), so a blob larger than one BSON document still stores and reads back. Chunking bounds the document, not memory: there is no streaming API, so each blob is held whole in process memory on both`put` and`get` . The manifest holds`MediaContext.metadata` inline and is not chunked, so keep per-blob metadata small.`collection=` renames both collections and`chunk_size_bytes=` (default 8 MiB) sets the split size.

Each store accepts a `public_url=` callable that turns the canonical `media+sha256://<hex>` URI into a URL the model can fetch directly. The forthcoming `MediaExternalizer` capability will use this to swap `BinaryContent` parts for `ImageUrl` / `AudioUrl` / other URL parts before the model sees the message, letting providers fetch big media over the wire without re-encoding bytes into the request body.

Static base URL (public R2 bucket, CDN):

```
from pydantic_ai_harness.media import S3MediaStore, make_static_public_url
store = S3MediaStore(
    bucket='my-bucket',
    endpoint='https://<acc>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com',
    region='auto',
    access_key_id=..., secret_access_key=...,
    key_prefix='media/',
    public_url=make_static_public_url('https://pub-abc.r2.dev', key_prefix='media/'),
)
```
Presigned or rotating-signature URL — pass any async callable that takes `(uri, MediaContext)`:

```
from pydantic_ai_harness.media import MediaContext, S3MediaStore
async def presign(uri: str, ctx: MediaContext) -> str:
    key = 'media/' + uri.removeprefix('media+sha256://') + '.bin'
    return await my_signer.generate(key, ttl=3600, content_type=ctx.media_type)
store = S3MediaStore(..., public_url=presign)
```
Every `MediaStore` method (`put`, `get`, `exists`, `public_url`, `get_metadata`) and both user-supplied callables (`PublicUrlResolver`, `KeyStrategy`) accept a `MediaContext`:

```
from collections.abc import Mapping
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
@dataclass(frozen=True, kw_only=True)
class MediaContext:
    media_type: str | None = None                    # e.g. 'image/png'
    filename: str | None = None                      # original filename, when known
    metadata: Mapping[str, str] = field(default_factory=dict)  # user-supplied tags
```
All fields default; new fields are added non-breakingly as use cases emerge. Pass what you have, ignore the rest.

**Persistence by store.** `get_metadata(uri)` round-trips the user-supplied `metadata` mapping on all four stores. `media_type` is also persisted but is not part of what `get_metadata` returns (it is stored for the byte payload itself, for example as the `Content-Type`).

- `SqliteMediaStore` writes`metadata` to a JSON column and`media_type` to a dedicated column.
- `S3MediaStore` sends`metadata` as signed`x-amz-meta-*` headers (ASCII alphanumeric plus dash key names) and`media_type` as`Content-Type` ;`get_metadata` reads the`x-amz-meta-*` values back from the HEAD response.
- `DiskMediaStore` writes a sidecar JSON file (`<resolved>.meta.json` ) alongside each blob, atomic via tmp plus rename. Sidecars are absent only when the put carried no metadata.
- `MongoMediaStore` writes`metadata` as a JSON string and`media_type` as a dedicated field on the blob’s manifest document (the`media` collection by default);`get_metadata` decodes the JSON string back. Because the mapping is one JSON string rather than nested fields, metadata keys are not subject to BSON field-name rules here.

Default is `<sha256>.bin`. `DiskMediaStore` and `S3MediaStore` accept overrides to fit existing layouts; `SqliteMediaStore` and `MongoMediaStore` do not (the digest is their primary key, so a user-chosen key would either break dedup or be a no-op — use `table=` / `collection=` to move the rows or documents):

```
from pydantic_ai_harness.media import DiskMediaStore, MediaContext
def by_media_type(uri: str, ctx: MediaContext) -> str:
    digest = uri.removeprefix('media+sha256://')
    ext = {'image/png': '.png', 'image/jpeg': '.jpg'}.get(ctx.media_type or '', '.bin')
    return f'images/{digest}{ext}'
store = DiskMediaStore('runs', key_strategy=by_media_type)
```
**Caveat**: if your strategy depends on `context.media_type` (for example, to pick an extension), `get(uri)` and `exists(uri)` will not find the blob unless the same context is supplied at read time. For pure path-organisation strategies (no context dependency) the constraint does not apply.

`DiskMediaStore` rejects strategies that produce absolute paths or paths containing `..` segments, to prevent escaping the store directory.

Separately, all four stores accept a `public_url=` resolver, useful when a CDN, local HTTP server, or signed-URL service fronts the bytes. Without it `public_url(...)` returns `None` (the model never sees a URL unless a resolver is configured and it returns a string).

pydantic_ai providers transparently download bytes from a URL when the target model does not natively accept that URL type, so emitting a URL is always safe: you only ever lose wire savings, never correctness.

DynamoDB, Postgres, Redis, GCS, and other backends are out of scope for this release. Write your own `StepStore` (about ten methods on a Protocol) or your own `MediaStore` (five methods: `put`, `get`, `exists`, `public_url`, `get_metadata`) and pass it via `store=` / `media_store=`. Please open an issue if you ship one — we want to feed the eventual shared adapter layer with N >= 3 real implementations before abstracting.

- It does not restore capability per-run state, graph-node state, retry counters, or in-flight streaming responses.
- It does not deduplicate replayed side effects automatically. Tools that write artifacts, labels, PRs, or external state should call `annotate_tool_effect(store, ctx, ...)` (see[Failure recovery](#failure-recovery) ) so the orchestrator can decide whether replay is safe.
- It does not prune events, and by default does not prune snapshots. Retention is the caller’s responsibility; snapshot growth can be bounded opt-in with `max_snapshots_per_run` (see[Bounding snapshot growth](#bounding-snapshot-growth) ).
- It does not garbage-collect externalized media. Pruning a snapshot leaves its content-addressed blobs in place, since they may be shared across snapshots and runs.
- It does not emit OpenTelemetry spans. pydantic_ai’s `Instrumentation` capability already spans`agent run` /`chat` /`running tool` and populates`gen_ai.agent.name` ,`gen_ai.agent.call.id` ,`gen_ai.conversation.id` via baggage. A future change may add step-persistence attributes to the active span; that is tracked as a follow-up issue.

**Bases:** `AbstractCapability[AgentDepsT]`

Append-only step log + continuable snapshots + tool-effect ledger.

The capability emits a `StepEvent` at every interesting boundary
(run/model-request/tool-call start, completion, failure), records a
`ToolEffectRecord` per tool call so the orchestrator can decide whether
replay is safe, and saves a `ContinuableSnapshot` at every settled
`CallToolsNode` boundary — folding in the pending tool-return request, so
the point is durable the moment the tool completes — plus a fallback save
at `after_run` when the run ends past that boundary. A run that *fails*
saves the live at-failure history (see `on_run_error`), classified by its
tool-work state: `complete` when every tool call is resolved,
`interrupted` otherwise.

A run that crashes between `before_tool_execute` and `after_tool_execute`
leaves a visible event trail, a `started` tool-effect record (the
`unknown_after_crash` signal), and an `interrupted` snapshot carrying
every completed cycle. The default `latest_snapshot` / `continue_run`
read path only returns `complete` snapshots; pass
`include_interrupted=True` to resume from the interrupted frontier after
consulting `list_unresolved_tool_effects`.

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import StepPersistence, InMemoryStepStore
store = InMemoryStepStore()
librarian = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    capabilities=[StepPersistence(store=store, agent_name='code_librarian')],
)
await librarian.run('Find ThinkingPartDelta and confirm the callable allowance')
```
Use `continue_run(store, run_id=...)` / `fork_run(store, run_id=...)`
to load a prior snapshot, then pass the result to
`Agent.run(..., message_history=...)`.

Backend that records events, snapshots, and tool effects.

**Type:** `StepStore` **Default:** `field(default_factory=InMemoryStepStore)`

Logical agent name (e.g. `code_librarian`, `reproducer`).

Used as a stable prefix for the auto-derived `run_id` so store
inspection shows readable IDs like `code_librarian-a3b2`.

**Type:** [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) | `None`**Default:** `None`

Identifier for this one `Agent.run` call.

`run_id` is per-call, matching `pydantic_ai.RunContext.run_id`. For
multi-turn logical grouping use `conversation_id` on `Agent.run(...)` —
that is the pyai-native primitive for it.

Resolution order (materialised in `for_run`):

1. **Explicit value** → used as-is. Single-shot use cases:
deterministic id for testing, replay, debugging. Reusing the
capability across multiple`.run()` calls with the same explicit`run_id` raises`ValueError` in`before_run` — the tool-effect
ledger keys on`(run_id, tool_call_id)` and providers reuse
deterministic tool-call ids, so a silent collision would erase
the`unknown_after_crash` signal. Use`conversation_id=` on`Agent.run` for multi-turn grouping.
2. **`agent_name` set, `run_id` unset** →`{agent_name}-{short-uuid}` ,
freshly materialised per`.run()` . Reusing the capability instance
yields distinct ids. Recommended default for delegate capabilities.
3. **Neither set** →`ctx.run_id` per`.run()` , falling back to UUID4.

**Type:** [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) | `None`**Default:** `None`

Run that spawned this one.

Auto-inferred from the enclosing `StepPersistence` `wrap_run` scope —
when an orchestrator’s tool synchronously calls a delegate’s
`Agent.run(...)`, the delegate picks up the orchestrator’s `run_id`
here without manual threading. Set explicitly to override (e.g. for
cross-process delegation where `ContextVar`s do not propagate).

**Type:** [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) | `None`**Default:** `None`

Free-form metadata stored on the `RunRecord` and on each event.

**Type:** [`dict`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#dict)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str), [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)] **Default:** `field(default_factory=_empty_metadata)`

`@classmethod`

```
def from_spec(cls, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> StepPersistence[Any]
```
Construct from a serialised spec.

Supports `backend='memory'` (default), `backend='file'` (with
`directory`), or `backend='sqlite'` (with `database`). Raises
`ValueError` for any other `backend` value — silently falling
back to in-memory storage would turn a typo into accidental
non-durability.

`max_snapshots_per_run` (default `None`, unbounded) is forwarded to
the constructed store to bound per-run snapshot growth.

`StepPersistence`[[`Any`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any)]

```
def compaction_transcript_handle() -> str | None
```
Retrieval handle to this run’s transcript, for compaction receipts.

Satisfies the compaction `TranscriptHandleProvider` protocol structurally (no import
coupling). A compaction strategy discovers this capability via `RunContext.capabilities`
and records its run id. Returns `None` before `for_run` has materialised the id.

`@async`

```
def for_run(ctx: RunContext[AgentDepsT]) -> AbstractCapability[AgentDepsT]
```
Materialise `run_id` and `parent_run_id` for this `Agent.run` call.

Reads the contextvar set by any enclosing `StepPersistence.wrap_run`
before the local run overwrites it, so a delegate’s `parent_run_id`
ends up pointing at its orchestrator’s `run_id`.

A separate `ContextVar` is needed because pydantic_ai’s own
cross-run signals (`RUN_ID_BAGGAGE_KEY` via OTel baggage,
`RunContext.run_id`, and `_CURRENT_RUN_CONTEXT`) are single-slot:
the inner `Instrumentation.wrap_run` overwrites them before any
nested capability sees the parent. The harness-local contextvar
lets us snapshot the parent here, *before* the local `wrap_run`
rebinds it.

`AbstractCapability`[`AgentDepsT`]

`@async`

```
def wrap_run(
    ctx: RunContext[AgentDepsT],
    *,
    handler: WrapRunHandler,
) -> AgentRunResult[Any]
```
Push this run’s id onto the contextvar so nested delegates can read it.

`@async`

```
def before_run(ctx: RunContext[AgentDepsT]) -> None
```
Register run lineage and emit `run_started`.

When the caller pinned an explicit `run_id`, reject reuse — the
tool-effect ledger keys on `(run_id, tool_call_id)` and providers
reuse deterministic tool-call ids, so a second `Agent.run` with
the same explicit `run_id` would silently collide. The auto-derived
cases cannot trigger this check because each call materialises a
fresh id in `for_run`.

`@async`

```
def after_run(
    ctx: RunContext[AgentDepsT],
    *,
    result: AgentRunResult[Any],
) -> AgentRunResult[Any]
```
Emit `run_completed`, saving a final snapshot only as a fallback.

When a terminal `CallToolsNode` already saved the final history via
`after_node_run` it carries the correct `step_index`, whereas by
`after_run` `ctx.run_step` is reset to 0 — so re-saving would both
duplicate the tail and stamp a misleading `step_index`. We save only
when the run ended past the newest boundary snapshot.

That covers a run which reached no provider-valid boundary at all, and
`Agent.run_stream`, which ends through `SetFinalResult` rather than a
terminal `CallToolsNode` and appends its closing response after the last
boundary — leaving `after_run` the only hook that sees the full run.

`@async`

```
def on_run_error(
    ctx: RunContext[AgentDepsT],
    *,
    error: BaseException,
) -> AgentRunResult[Any]
```
Persist the live at-failure history as the run’s last resume point, then emit `run_failed`.

The single error-path save site: reads the list reference stashed by
`after_node_run` (see `_stash_live_history`), whose content at this
point is the full history the run had built when it failed — including
a failing model request’s payload and any partial tool returns captured
by the graph during unwind. Nothing is compared against the store:
the live history is by definition the newest state, so an earlier
boundary snapshot is simply superseded, and a history a sticky
processor trimmed is persisted as trimmed — exactly what the next
request would have sent.

The history is saved whenever it contains a model response (a bare
prompt equals restarting the run), classified `complete` when every
tool call is resolved and `interrupted` otherwise. Interrupted
snapshots stay off the default `latest_snapshot` read path.

`@async`

```
def on_model_request_error(
    ctx: RunContext[AgentDepsT],
    *,
    request_context: ModelRequestContext,
    error: Exception,
) -> ModelResponse
```
Emit `model_request_failed` and re-raise.

No snapshot is saved here: the failing request’s payload already sits
in the live history (the graph appends the request before sending), so
`on_run_error`’s save covers it. A failure the model layer recovers
from (retry, fallback) needs no rescue at all.

`@async`

```
def after_node_run(
    ctx: RunContext[AgentDepsT],
    *,
    node: AgentNode[AgentDepsT],
    result: NodeResult[AgentDepsT],
) -> NodeResult[AgentDepsT]
```
Save a continuable snapshot after a settled `CallToolsNode`, and refresh the live-history stash.

At that boundary every tool call from the preceding `ModelRequestNode`
has a matching tool return, so the history is provider-valid. The
returned `ModelRequestNode` carries those returns and is not yet in
`ctx.messages`, so its request is folded in before validation —
without it a worker killed right after a completed tool call would
leave no resume point at all (#373). `is_provider_valid` doubles as a
defense in case a custom node reshapes history, and the saved count
goes to `snapshot_saved` so `after_run` can tell whether the run ended
past this boundary.

This save is the durable one: it lands in the store while the run is
still healthy, so it survives a hard kill that fires no hook. The
error path (`on_run_error`) only rescues histories that a raise unwinds
through.

Every node boundary also re-stashes the live message list so that
`on_run_error` can persist the at-failure history when a later node
raises before its own `after_node_run` fires. The stash holds that list
by reference, so the snapshot candidate rebinds to a new list rather
than appending to it — an append would leak `result.request` into the
history the error path later reads, duplicating it once the graph
appends the request itself.
