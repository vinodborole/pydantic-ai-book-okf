# StackOne

Use `StackOne` when an agent needs to work with one of a user’s linked business applications, such as BambooHR,
Salesforce, or Zendesk. Each instance is scoped to one linked account, which is one authenticated connection between
[StackOne](https://www.stackone.com) and a provider.

While Pydantic AI Harness is on 0.x releases, the API may change between minor releases; when it does, deprecation warnings and release-note migration guidance tell you (or your agent) exactly how to upgrade. See the [version policy](/docs/ai/harness/#version-policy).

Follow the [StackOne docs](https://docs.stackone.com) to:

1. Configure a connector and link an account. For your first test, enable only the read actions you need.
2. Copy the linked account ID from the StackOne dashboard.
3. Create a StackOne API key that can execute actions.

You also need an API key for the model your agent uses.

The `openai` and `spec` extras support the model and agent-spec examples below. Install the provider extra for a
different model provider instead.

Set the credentials in the shell where you will run the example:

`StackOne` reads `STACKONE_API_KEY` automatically. The example reads `STACKONE_ACCOUNT_ID` explicitly so the account
ID is not hard-coded. You can pass `api_key=` directly instead, but keep secrets out of source control.

```
import os
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import StackOne
agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    capabilities=[
        StackOne(account_id=os.environ['STACKONE_ACCOUNT_ID']),
    ],
)
result = agent.run_sync('List the first 5 employees')
print(result.output)
```
By default, the model receives two tools. It searches for an action that matches the request, then executes the returned action ID. The final output depends on the linked provider and its data.

StackOne controls which actions are enabled for the linked account. Treat that configuration as the primary access control.

Use `actions` when you also want to limit which tools the model sees. Patterns use Python
[`fnmatch`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html) syntax, where `*` is a wildcard. They ignore case and match
the full `{connector}_{action}_{entity}` tool name:

```
from pydantic_ai_harness import StackOne
StackOne(account_id='your-linked-account-id', actions=['*_list_*'])            # All matching list tools
StackOne(account_id='your-linked-account-id', actions=['workday_get_worker'])  # One exact tool
```
Passing `actions` selects `individual` mode automatically. Explicitly combining `actions` with
`tool_mode='search_execute'` raises an error because that mode registers only the search and execute tools.

| Mode | What the model receives | Use it when | 
|---|---|---|
| `search_execute` | Two tools: search for an action, then execute it by ID | The account has many enabled actions. This is the default when `actions` is omitted. | 
| `individual` | One tool and schema per enabled action | You need to select exact actions or add per-tool behavior. Passing `actions` selects this mode. | 

In `search_execute` mode, action IDs are returned by the search tool at runtime and should not be guessed. In
`individual` mode, all selected tool schemas are sent to the model, so filter large action sets with `actions`.

To keep StackOne tools out of the model context until they are needed, pass `defer_loading=True`. The capability uses
`id='stackone'` by default so it can be loaded on demand. Give each instance a distinct `id` when one agent uses
multiple StackOne accounts:

```
from pydantic_ai_harness import StackOne
StackOne(account_id='your-linked-account-id', defer_loading=True)
```
Provider actions can return large exports. Combine StackOne with the [Tool Output Limits](/docs/ai/harness/tool-output-limits/)
capability to reduce oversized tool returns agent-wide:

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import StackOne, ToolOutputLimits
agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    capabilities=[
        StackOne(account_id='your-linked-account-id'),
        ToolOutputLimits(),
    ],
)
```
Approval is not enabled automatically. For operations that need human confirmation, use the public
`StackOneToolset` with Pydantic AI’s [tool approval](/docs/ai/tools-toolsets/toolsets/#requiring-tool-approval):

```
import os
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness.stackone import StackOneToolset
stackone_tools = StackOneToolset(
    account_id=os.environ['STACKONE_ACCOUNT_ID'],
    actions=['workday_create_worker'],
).approval_required()
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5', toolsets=[stackone_tools])
```
Handle the resulting deferred approval requests as described in the linked guide.

The capability also works with Pydantic AI’s [agent spec](/docs/ai/core-concepts/agent-spec/) format for YAML or JSON.
Keep the API key in `STACKONE_API_KEY` rather than storing it in the file:

```
# agent.yaml
model: openai:gpt-5
capabilities:
  - StackOne:
      account_id: 'your-linked-account-id'
      actions: ['*_list_*']
```
```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import StackOne
agent = Agent.from_file('agent.yaml', custom_capability_types=[StackOne])
```
Pass `custom_capability_types` so the spec loader knows how to instantiate `StackOne`.

Use the lower-level `StackOneToolset` directly when you need
[`Agent(toolsets=\[...\])`](/docs/ai/tools-toolsets/toolsets/) or other toolset wrappers.

Custom `base_url` and URL-valued `client` values must use HTTPS. The toolset adds auth headers and appends the
`tool-mode` query parameter for URL values when it is absent. It raises an error when the URL’s `tool-mode` conflicts
with the configured mode because rewriting would invalidate signed URLs. When using `search_execute` with a signed
URL, include `tool-mode=search_execute` before signing. Prebuilt clients are used as-is; configure their HTTPS
transport, auth, account selection, and tool mode yourself.

**Bases:** `AbstractCapability[AgentDepsT]`

Actions on the user’s SaaS account (HRIS, ATS, CRM, and more) via StackOne.

Connects an agent to one linked account’s actions over StackOne’s MCP endpoint, with authentication, tool filtering, and usage instructions.

The linked account to act on (one account is one provider connection).

**Type:** `str`

`fnmatch` globs over full tool names (case-insensitive), e.g. `['*_list_*']`.
Giving `actions` switches the default `tool_mode` to `individual`, where the globs apply.

**Type:** [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) | [`Sequence`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Sequence)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)] **Default:** `()`

StackOne API key. Defaults to the `STACKONE_API_KEY` environment variable.

**Type:** [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) | `None`**Default:** `field(default=None, repr=False)`

HTTPS StackOne API host. Point at a regional or staging host if needed.

**Type:** `str`**Default:** `STACKONE_BASE_URL`

Replacement for the default `{base_url}/mcp` connection. URL values must use HTTPS;
prebuilt clients keep their own transport, auth, and account selection, so `account_id`
is not applied to them.

**Type:** `MCPToolsetClient` | `None`**Default:** `field(default=None, repr=False)`

Routing description used when the capability is loaded on demand.

**Type:** [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) | `None`**Default:** `_DEFAULT_DESCRIPTION`

Stable capability and toolset ID. Override it when one agent uses several StackOne accounts.

**Type:** [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) | `None`**Default:** `_DEFAULT_ID`

Inject StackOne usage instructions into the system prompt.

**Type:** `bool`**Default:** `True`

Metadata merged onto every tool, available to tool-selection machinery such as
`CodeMode(tools={'code_mode': True})` or custom `prepare_tools` hooks.

**Type:** [`Mapping`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Mapping)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str), [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-object)] | `None`**Default:** `None`

`individual` registers one tool per enabled action; `search_execute` registers two
server-side meta-tools (search the catalog, execute an action by id) whose prompt
footprint stays constant however large the catalog is. `None` picks `search_execute`,
or `individual` when `actions` are given.

**Type:** `ToolMode` | `None`**Default:** `None`

`@classmethod`

```
def from_spec(
    cls,
    account_id: str,
    *,
    id: str | None = _DEFAULT_ID,
    description: str | None = _DEFAULT_DESCRIPTION,
    defer_loading: bool = False,
    api_key: str | None = None,
    base_url: str = STACKONE_BASE_URL,
    actions: str | Sequence[str] = (),
    tool_mode: ToolMode | None = None,
    include_instructions: bool = True,
    metadata: Mapping[str, object] | None = None,
) -> StackOne[AgentDepsT]
```
Construct from serializable options, excluding the runtime-only `client`.

`StackOne`[`AgentDepsT`]

```
def get_instructions() -> str | None
```
StackOne usage guidance; the underlying MCP toolset provides none itself.

`@classmethod`

```
def get_serialization_name(cls) -> str
```
Return the agent-spec capability name.

```
def get_toolset() -> StackOneToolset[AgentDepsT]
```
Build the StackOne toolset.

`StackOneToolset`[`AgentDepsT`]

**Bases:** `MCPToolset[AgentDepsT]`

StackOne actions on one linked SaaS account, as an agent toolset.

An `MCPToolset` connected to StackOne’s MCP endpoint. URL clients receive
StackOne auth and account headers. Action filtering and metadata merging
apply to the tools listed by the server. Prebuilt clients keep their own
transport configuration. Instances support the full `MCPToolset` surface.

Use the `StackOne` capability for usage instructions and agent-spec support.
Use this class for toolset combinators such as `approval_required()`.

```
def __init__(
    *,
    account_id: str,
    api_key: str | None = None,
    base_url: str = STACKONE_BASE_URL,
    actions: Sequence[str] = (),
    tool_mode: ToolMode | None = None,
    metadata: Mapping[str, object] | None = None,
    client: MCPToolsetClient | None = None,
    id: str = 'stackone',
) -> None
```
Build a StackOne MCP toolset.

**`account_id`** : `str`

Linked account used for StackOne requests.

API key, or `STACKONE_API_KEY` when omitted.

**`base_url`** : `str`*Default:* `STACKONE_BASE_URL` 

HTTPS StackOne API host.

Case-insensitive globs over individual action tool names. Selects
`individual`; incompatible with explicit `search_execute`.

**`tool_mode`** : `ToolMode` | `None`*Default:* `None` 

Individual tools or the search/execute pair. Inferred when omitted.

Metadata merged onto each tool definition.

**`client`** : `MCPToolsetClient` | `None`*Default:* `None` 

URL, `FastMCP`, or prebuilt client accepted by `MCPToolset`.
Non-URL clients keep their own transport, auth, and account selection,
so `account_id` is not applied to them.

**`id`** : `str`*Default:* `'stackone'` 

Toolset ID; use distinct values for multiple accounts.
