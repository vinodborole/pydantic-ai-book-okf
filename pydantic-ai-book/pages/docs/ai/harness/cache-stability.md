# Cache Stability Monitor

Warn when a run’s prompt cache hit collapses between model requests, so a moved cacheable prefix or an expired provider cache surfaces instead of quietly re-charging tokens it could have served from cache.

[!NOTE] Import this capability from its submodule. It is not re-exported from

`pydantic_ai_harness`:`from pydantic_ai_harness.cache_stability import CacheStabilityMonitor`

Cache Stability Monitor is a released, non-experimental capability. Pydantic AI Harness is still on 0.x releases, so the API may change between minor releases. See the [version policy](/docs/ai/harness/#version-policy).

Prompt caching pays off only while the cacheable prefix (tools, then system instructions, then message history) stays byte-stable across a run’s consecutive requests. When something moves that prefix — reordered tools, a timestamp injected into instructions, a serialization-level block hop — the provider re-charges tokens it could have served from cache.

This is the **observe** signal: it reads the provider’s own verdict rather than guessing from the structured request. On each response it reads `usage.cache_read_tokens` and tracks the largest cacheable prefix the run has established (`cache_read_tokens + cache_write_tokens`, a high-water mark), keyed by the response’s `(provider_name, model_name)`. Because message history is append-only, a stable prefix means each request for that model reads back at least what the previous one cached; a large drop is the observable signature of a collapse.

When a request reads back less than `collapse_ratio` of the established prefix, the monitor emits a `CacheBustWarning` once and latches that key, staying quiet about the collapse until a healthy read-back re-stabilizes the cache. A sustained collapse — caching toggled off mid-run (`read == 0, write == 0`), or a prefix that moves every request so the provider keeps writing a cache nothing reads back — therefore warns once, not on every request.

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness.cache_stability import CacheStabilityMonitor
agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5', capabilities=[CacheStabilityMonitor()])
await agent.run('...')  # a CacheBustWarning fires if a cached prefix collapses mid-run
```
The verdict is cross-provider for free — pyai normalizes every provider into the `cache_read_tokens` / `cache_write_tokens` fields on `RequestUsage`.

Keying per provider and model means a mid-run model switch does not warn: a `FallbackModel` failover or a per-step model change uses a different cache key, so the monitor starts a fresh mark for it instead of comparing against the previous model’s. Marks are kept per key rather than reset, so switching back to an earlier model within its cache TTL still compares against that model’s prefix.

A collapse has two shapes the monitor cannot tell apart, so the warning names both: the cacheable prefix moved, or the provider’s cache expired under an unchanged prefix (a gap between requests longer than the cache TTL — Anthropic’s default is 5 minutes, refreshed on each hit). When the gap since the same model’s previous request exceeds `cache_ttl_seconds`, the message reports the gap so a long tool or approval pause isn’t mistaken for a moved prefix. The gap is timed per model, so switching away and back measures the returning model’s own idle time, not whatever ran in between.

- `collapse_ratio`(default- `0.5`): warn when a request reads back less than this fraction of the established prefix. Conservative by default so ordinary rounding or a partial miss does not fire; raise toward- `1.0`to warn on smaller regressions. It must be greater than- `0.0`— a ratio of- `0.0`could never warn, so it is rejected rather than treated as a silent disable switch.
- `min_prefix_tokens`(default- `1024`): only judge collapse once the established prefix reaches this many tokens. Below a provider’s minimum cacheable size (Anthropic’s is 1024)- `cache_read_tokens`is noisy or zero.
- `cache_ttl_seconds`(default- `300`): the assumed provider cache TTL. Message-only — when the gap since the same model’s previous request exceeds it, the warning notes the collapse may be a cache expiry rather than a moved prefix. It does not change whether a warning fires. Lower it for providers with a shorter cache lifetime.

There is no bespoke suppression API. Use the stdlib `warnings` machinery, exactly as you would manage any other `UserWarning`:

```
import warnings
from pydantic_ai_harness.cache_stability import CacheBustWarning
# Silence the whole category:
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=CacheBustWarning)
# Silence one intentional bust, scoped to the operation that causes it:
with warnings.catch_warnings():
    warnings.simplefilter('ignore', CacheBustWarning)
    result = agent.run_sync('...')  # e.g. a step that switches models or adds a file
# Treat every bust as an error (dev/CI enforcement):
warnings.filterwarnings('error', category=CacheBustWarning)
```
In tests, assert an intentional bust with `pytest.warns(CacheBustWarning)`, or silence a legitimately-busting test with `@pytest.mark.filterwarnings('ignore::pydantic_ai_harness.cache_stability.CacheBustWarning')`.

Logfire bridges the stdlib `logging` module, not the `warnings` module, so a `CacheBustWarning` does not reach your traces on its own. To route busts into Logfire, redirect Python warnings to the `logging` system once at startup:

```
import logging
logging.captureWarnings(True)  # warnings.warn(...) -> the 'py.warnings' logger -> Logfire
```
The monitor’s signal is the `CacheBustWarning`; routing it through `logging` is how it reaches Logfire.

- The monitor only implements `for_run`and`after_model_request`; it adds no tools, instructions, or model settings, so it composes with any other capability, toolset, or`ToolSearch`setup without interference.
- Per-run state (the per-key marks and timing) is materialized in `for_run`, so one`CacheStabilityMonitor`instance can be reused across many`Agent.run`calls — each run is judged independently.

- **Observational only.**It reports that a cached prefix collapsed, not why — a moved prefix and a provider-side cache expiry look the same from the token counts, so the warning names both. The structural explanation (“what moved the prefix this turn”) is a separate job.
- **Fires only when caching is enabled and reported.**A run that never establishes a cache never warns.
- **A mid-run model switch does not warn.**Marks are per- `(provider_name, model_name)`, so a- `FallbackModel`failover starts a fresh mark rather than collapsing the previous model’s.

The public module exports `CacheStabilityMonitor` and `CacheBustWarning`. Import them from `pydantic_ai_harness.cache_stability`.

**Bases:** `AbstractCapability[AgentDepsT]`

Warn when a run’s prompt cache hit collapses between requests.

Attach it to any agent whose model uses prompt caching. On each response the monitor
reads `usage.cache_read_tokens` and tracks the largest cacheable prefix the run has
established (`cache_read_tokens + cache_write_tokens`, a high-water mark), keyed by the
response’s `(provider_name, model_name)`. When a later request for the same key reads back
fewer than `collapse_ratio` of that established prefix, it emits a `CacheBustWarning` once
and then stays quiet about that collapse until a healthy read-back re-stabilizes the cache,
so a sustained collapse warns once rather than on every subsequent request.

Keying per provider and model means a mid-run model switch does not warn: a `FallbackModel`
failover or a per-step model change uses a different cache key, so it starts a fresh mark
for that key instead of comparing against the previous model’s. Marks are kept per key
rather than reset, so switching back to an earlier model within its cache TTL still compares
against that model’s established prefix — and the expiry hedge measures the gap against that
same model’s previous request, not whatever ran in between.

Because message history is append-only, a stable prefix means each request reads back at least what the previous one cached. A large drop is the observable signature of a collapse, whether the cause is a moved prefix (reordered tools, injected timestamps, a serialization-level block hop) or a provider-side cache expiry when the gap between requests exceeds the cache TTL. The monitor surfaces the collapse; it does not attribute the cause.

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness.cache_stability import CacheStabilityMonitor
agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5', capabilities=[CacheStabilityMonitor()])
await agent.run('...')  # a CacheBustWarning fires if a cached prefix collapses mid-run
```
The monitor is silent when caching is off or unreported (`cache_read_tokens` stays 0), so
it never fires spuriously in tests that don’t exercise caching. Silencing and dev/CI
escalation both go through the stdlib `warnings` filters — see `CacheBustWarning`.

Warn when a request reads back less than this fraction of the established prefix.

Conservative by default (0.5): only a drop below half the previously-cached prefix counts as a collapse, so ordinary provider rounding or a partial cache miss does not fire. Raise it toward 1.0 to warn on smaller regressions. Must be greater than 0.0 (a ratio of 0.0 could never warn, so it is rejected rather than treated as a silent disable switch).

**Type:** `float`**Default:** `0.5`

Only judge collapse once the established prefix reaches this many tokens.

Below a provider’s minimum cacheable size (Anthropic’s is 1024) `cache_read_tokens` is
noisy or zero, so small prefixes are ignored to avoid false positives.

**Type:** `int`**Default:** `1024`

Assumed provider cache TTL, in seconds (Anthropic’s default is 300, refreshed on each hit).

Message-only: when the gap since the previous request for the same model exceeds this, the warning notes that the collapse may be a provider-side cache expiry rather than a moved prefix. It does not change whether a warning fires. Lower it for providers with a shorter cache lifetime.

**Type:** `float`**Default:** `300.0`

`@async`

```
def for_run(ctx: RunContext[AgentDepsT]) -> AbstractCapability[AgentDepsT]
```
Give this run a fresh per-key state (marks, timing, step) so each run is judged alone.

`AbstractCapability`[`AgentDepsT`]

`@async`

```
def after_model_request(
    ctx: RunContext[AgentDepsT],
    *,
    request_context: ModelRequestContext,
    response: ModelResponse,
) -> ModelResponse
```
Compare this response’s cache read against the established prefix for its model, then update it.

**Bases:** `UserWarning`

Warned when a previously-established prompt cache hit collapses on a later request.

Emitted by `CacheStabilityMonitor` when this run read back far fewer cached tokens for the
same provider and model than a prior request established. The likely causes are a moved
cacheable prefix (reordered tools, injected timestamps, a serialization-level block hop) or a
provider-side cache expiry under an unchanged prefix (a gap between requests longer than the
cache TTL). The monitor observes the collapse; it does not attribute the cause.

Silence it, or escalate it to an error in dev/CI, with the stdlib `warnings` machinery
(no bespoke API):

import warnings from pydantic_ai_harness.cache_stability import CacheBustWarning

warnings.filterwarnings(‘ignore’, category=CacheBustWarning)

with warnings.catch_warnings(): warnings.simplefilter(‘ignore’, CacheBustWarning) result = agent.run_sync(’…’) # e.g. a step that switches models or adds a file

warnings.filterwarnings(‘error’, category=CacheBustWarning)

In tests, assert an intentional bust with `pytest.warns(CacheBustWarning)`, or silence
a legitimately-busting test with
`@pytest.mark.filterwarnings('ignore::pydantic_ai_harness.cache_stability.CacheBustWarning')`.
