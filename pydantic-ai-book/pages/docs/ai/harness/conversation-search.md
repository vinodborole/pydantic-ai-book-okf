# Conversation Search

`ConversationSearch` gives the model a `search_conversation_history` tool that BM25-ranks the history a `StepPersistence` capability already persists — earlier turns that compaction dropped from the live context, and past runs in the same conversation by default.

While Pydantic AI Harness is on 0.x releases, the API may change between minor releases; when it does, deprecation warnings and release-note migration guidance tell you (or your agent) exactly how to upgrade. See the [version policy](/docs/ai/harness/#version-policy).

Compaction capabilities (`SlidingWindowCompaction`, `SummarizingCompaction`, …) narrow the live history so it fits the context window. `SummarizingCompaction` persists its edits: once a prefix is replaced by a summary, the originals are gone from the run’s `message_history` on the next turn. The model can no longer recall an exact file path, a decision, or a value stated earlier — only the summary’s paraphrase of it. And nothing at all from previous runs is reachable, however well persisted.

`ConversationSearch` persists nothing itself. It reads whatever a persistence capability already stores, through a `HistorySource`, and exposes one tool, `search_conversation_history`, that BM25-ranks that history so the model can pull exact details back into context on demand.

The shipped source, `SnapshotHistorySource`, reads the snapshots `StepPersistence` writes: pair the two capabilities on a shared store instance and recall works with no extra write path, no ordering constraints, and no hook coordination. Search is conversation-scoped by default, so pass the same `conversation_id` on every run that should share a corpus:

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import ConversationSearch, SlidingWindowCompaction, StepPersistence
from pydantic_ai_harness.conversation_search import SnapshotHistorySource
from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import SqliteStepStore
store = SqliteStepStore(database='sessions.db')
agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    capabilities=[
        StepPersistence(store=store),
        ConversationSearch(SnapshotHistorySource(store), scope='conversation'),
        SlidingWindowCompaction(max_messages=40),
    ],
)
async def ask(question: str, conversation_id: str) -> str:
    result = await agent.run(question, conversation_id=conversation_id)
    return result.output
```
- Ranking is BM25 (the algorithm behind Lucene/Elasticsearch), implemented in pure Python — no new dependencies. Rare terms and exact matches score higher; multi-word queries score each word independently.
- Reaching a past run requires both runs to share a `conversation_id` . pydantic-ai resolves one per run: an explicit`conversation_id=` wins, otherwise the most recent`conversation_id` on`message_history` is inherited, otherwise a fresh one is generated. Threading`message_history` through follow-up runs therefore keeps them in one conversation; runs sharing neither an explicit id nor a history chain are separate.
- Results carry provenance (`run: ... | conversation: ...` ), and the tool’s optional`run_id` argument scopes a search to one run — so a run referenced elsewhere (for example by a compaction receipt’s transcript handle) is directly resolvable.
- The search reads the store lazily at call time, so it always sees everything persisted so far, including earlier steps of the current run.

`StepPersistence` saves a full-history snapshot at every step boundary. A compaction strategy that persists its edits (like `SummarizingCompaction`) carries those edits into *later* snapshots — but the earlier snapshots of the same run were taken while the originals were still live. `SnapshotHistorySource` unions each run’s snapshots in write order, skips derived summary artifacts, and removes the overlap between the accumulated history’s suffix and each snapshot’s prefix. This recovers the originals plus everything compaction never touched while preserving repeated messages at distinct sequence positions — as far back as the store still retains those pre-compaction snapshots (see Limitations). Only `complete` snapshots contribute: `interrupted` captures (unsettled tool work, synthesized tool returns) are excluded by the stores’ default read gate.

Overlap matching keys off a content hash of each serialized message, not object identity: consecutive snapshots re-serialize the same growing history, and durable executors (Temporal, DBOS) re-instantiate messages between steps.

`HistorySource` is deliberately substrate-neutral (“enumerate runs, yield each run’s durable message record”): a persistence substrate that keeps an append-only entry log can implement it directly by replay, replacing the snapshot-union adapter without touching the search layer.

`scope='conversation'` restricts the corpus to runs whose `conversation_id` matches the calling run. Pass an authenticated, tenant-scoped value as `conversation_id` when running the agent:

```
agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    capabilities=[
        StepPersistence(store=store),
        ConversationSearch(SnapshotHistorySource(store), scope='conversation'),
    ],
)
async def ask(question: str, user_id: str) -> str:
    result = await agent.run(question, conversation_id=user_id)
    return result.output
```
The corpus is then restricted to runs whose `conversation_id` matches the calling run’s, the tool’s own description tells the model the restriction applies, and the tool’s `run_id` argument cannot reach past it — an out-of-scope run reports the same “no persisted history” answer as a run that does not exist.

pydantic-ai resolves the calling run’s `conversation_id` in a fixed order: the explicit `conversation_id=` argument to `Agent.run(...)`, then the most recent `conversation_id` carried on `message_history`, then a fresh UUID7. Passing `conversation_id='new'` forces a fresh one, forking a conversation off the supplied history.

That order has two consequences for this scope. A follow-up run that threads `message_history` inherits the previous run’s id, so it can search the runs behind it without passing the argument. A run that passes neither an explicit id nor a history chain gets an id of its own and reaches only itself — an omitted argument is not an error here, just a narrower corpus. Neither behavior is an isolation boundary to rely on for multi-tenant separation: pass an authenticated, tenant-scoped `conversation_id=` explicitly (it is the value `StepPersistence` records on the run).

A `RunContext` whose `conversation_id` is unset searches nothing under this scope and the tool says why. Matching on “conversation id is unset” would pool every unlabelled run in the store into one corpus, which is the exposure the scope exists to prevent, so it fails closed instead.

Scoping is applied to the `RunRecord`s a `HistorySource` returns, so a custom source must populate `conversation_id` on them for the default scope to match anything. Set `scope='all'` only when the store is already isolated to one principal. This opt-in mode searches every run the source enumerates and can return verbatim excerpts from any of them.

This default changed. Earlier releases defaulted to `scope='all'`, so one search ranked every run in the store; it now defaults to `conversation`. Nothing raises on upgrade — a caller who relied on the old default keeps working and simply stops seeing other conversations — so leaving `scope` unset emits a `HarnessDeprecationWarning` once per capability instance naming the change.

Set the option explicitly to resolve it. Both values are supported and neither is deprecated:

- `scope='all'` restores the previous store-wide behavior. Correct when the store holds a single principal’s history.
- `scope='conversation'` keeps the new behavior and silences the warning.

Silence every harness deprecation at once, if you would rather migrate later:

```
import warnings
from pydantic_ai_harness import HarnessDeprecationWarning
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=HarnessDeprecationWarning)
```
| Option | Default | Purpose | 
|---|---|---|
| `source` | (required) | Where the corpus comes from. Use `SnapshotHistorySource(store)` over the store`StepPersistence` writes to. | 
| `scope` | `'conversation'` (unset warns) | Restricts search to the calling run’s `conversation_id` . Use`'all'` only for a store isolated to one principal. Leaving it unset warns once; see Scope. | 
| `max_matches` | `10` | Maximum matching excerpts the search tool returns. | 
| `context_lines` | `5` | Lines shown around each match (within the match’s run). | 
| `bm25_k1` | `1.5` | BM25 term-frequency saturation. This capability’s default; Lucene’s `BM25Similarity` uses`1.2` . | 
| `bm25_b` | `0.75` | BM25 length normalization (Lucene default). | 
| `add_instructions` | `True` | Emit a short note telling the model the recall tool exists. | 
| `tool_id` | `conversation-search` | Toolset id for the search tool. | 

Persisted instruction replacements and withdrawals are searchable as system text. Their displayed excerpts are limited to 200 characters; the search index retains the full text.

- Search only reaches what was persisted: history inherited from runs that never ran with `StepPersistence` (for example a long`message_history` passed in from an unpersisted session) cannot be recovered if compaction drops it before the first snapshot.
- Recovery of compaction-dropped originals depends on the pre-compaction snapshots still being retained. A store with bounded snapshot retention (for example a per-run snapshot cap) can prune the early snapshots that held those originals; a search then returns only what the surviving snapshots still carry, degrading to a partial result rather than erroring. Retain full snapshot history for the run if complete recovery matters.
- The corpus is rebuilt on each tool call by reading every in-scope run’s snapshots. Snapshot storage is cumulative (each snapshot re-serializes the growing history), so a large in-scope history makes each search proportionally more expensive. A persistent index (SQLite FTS5, tracked in [#124](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness/issues/124) ) is the scaling path.
- Reading snapshots restores externalized media (large binary payloads) even though the text index never uses it; stores with remote media backends pay that fetch cost per search.

**Bases:** `AbstractCapability[AgentDepsT]`

Search persisted conversation history with a dependency-free BM25 tool.

This capability persists nothing itself: it reads whatever history a persistence
capability already stores, through a `HistorySource`. Pair it with
`StepPersistence` sharing the same store, and the model can recall what
compaction dropped from the live context as well as anything from past runs in
the same conversation:

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness.compaction import SlidingWindowCompaction
from pydantic_ai_harness.conversation_search import ConversationSearch, SnapshotHistorySource
from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import SqliteStepStore, StepPersistence
store = SqliteStepStore(database='sessions.db')
agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    capabilities=[
        StepPersistence(store=store),
        ConversationSearch(SnapshotHistorySource(store), scope='conversation'),
        SlidingWindowCompaction(max_messages=40),
    ],
)
async def ask(question: str, conversation_id: str) -> str:
    result = await agent.run(question, conversation_id=conversation_id)
    return result.output
```
Search is conversation-scoped by default, so reaching a past run requires both
runs to share a `conversation_id`. pydantic-ai resolves one per run: an explicit
`conversation_id=` wins, otherwise the most recent `conversation_id` on
`message_history` is inherited, otherwise a fresh one is generated. Threading
`message_history` through follow-up runs keeps them in one conversation; runs
sharing neither an explicit id nor a history chain are separate.

`scope` defaulted to `all` in earlier releases and now defaults to `conversation`.
Upgrading raises nothing — a store-wide caller keeps working with a narrower corpus
— so leaving `scope` unset emits a `HarnessDeprecationWarning` once per instance.
Pass `scope='all'` to restore the old behavior or `scope='conversation'` to keep the
new one; both are supported and neither is deprecated.

Some compaction strategies persist their edits into the run’s durable message
history (`SummarizingCompaction` replaces summarized prefixes for good; a
`SlidingWindowCompaction` trim only narrows what each request sends). Either way,
`StepPersistence` snapshots each step boundary before the next compaction runs,
so the union of a run’s snapshots still holds the originals —
`SnapshotHistorySource` recovers them. No ordering or hook coordination between
the capabilities is required; the search tool reads the store lazily at call
time.

Where the search corpus comes from. Use `SnapshotHistorySource` over the
store a `StepPersistence` capability writes to.

**Type:** `HistorySource`

How much of the store one search may reach.

`conversation` restricts the corpus to runs whose `conversation_id` matches the
calling run’s. A run with no `conversation_id` searches nothing and the tool says
so, rather than falling back to every other unlabelled run. `all` searches every
run the source enumerates and must only be used when the store is already isolated
to one principal.

`None` means the caller did not choose, which resolves to `conversation` and emits a
`HarnessDeprecationWarning` once per instance: this default was `all` in earlier
releases, and the change is otherwise silent because a store-wide caller keeps working
and simply stops seeing other conversations. Set the option explicitly to opt out of
the warning; both values are supported and neither is deprecated.

**Type:** `SearchScope` | `None`**Default:** `None`

Toolset id for the `search_conversation_history` tool.

**Type:** `str`**Default:** `'conversation-search'`

Maximum number of matching excerpts the search tool returns. Must be non-negative.

**Type:** `int`**Default:** `10`

Number of surrounding lines shown around each search match. Must be non-negative.

**Type:** `int`**Default:** `5`

BM25 term-frequency saturation, non-negative. This capability’s default; Lucene’s
`BM25Similarity` uses `1.2`.

**Type:** `float`**Default:** `1.5`

BM25 length-normalization, between `0.0` and `1.0` (Lucene/Elasticsearch default).

**Type:** `float`**Default:** `0.75`

Emit a short instruction telling the model the recall tool exists.

**Type:** `bool`**Default:** `True`

The scope actually applied: the caller’s choice, or `conversation` when unset.

**Type:** `SearchScope`

```
def __post_init__() -> None
```
Warn once, at construction, when the caller left `scope` to the changed default.

Construction is where the caller’s choice (or non-choice) is expressed, so warning
here fires once per instance instead of once per `search_conversation_history` call.

```
def get_toolset() -> AgentToolset[AgentDepsT] | None
```
Provide the `search_conversation_history` tool over the source.

[`AgentToolset`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/toolsets/#pydantic_ai.toolsets.AgentToolset)[`AgentDepsT`] | `None`

```
def get_instructions() -> AgentInstructions[AgentDepsT] | None
```
Tell the model the recall tool exists, unless `add_instructions` is false.

The wording follows `scope` so it never describes a corpus narrower than the
one configured.

`AgentInstructions`[`AgentDepsT`] | `None`
