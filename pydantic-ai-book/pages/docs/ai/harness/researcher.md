# Researcher

`Researcher` gives a Pydantic AI agent a compact stack for broad web research with source-backed answers.
It is a regular [combined capability](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/capabilities/custom/#composition-and-middleware-semantics) made from the [capabilities](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/capabilities/overview/) below, so you can use it as-is or take it apart.

While Pydantic AI Harness is on 0.x releases, the API may change between minor releases; when it does, deprecation warnings and release-note migration guidance tell you (or your agent) exactly how to upgrade. See the [version policy](/docs/ai/harness/#version-policy).

Install the local search and fetch fallbacks (DuckDuckGo search, page-to-Markdown fetching):

Then ask it a question:

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import Researcher
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.6-sol', capabilities=[Researcher()])
result = agent.run_sync('What changed in the last three major releases of Django?')
print(result.output)
```
The same agent works with every Pydantic AI interface: [`agent.to_cli_sync()`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/cli/) for terminal chat, [`agent.to_web()`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/web/) for a browser chat UI.

Or skip the file entirely and run the exported [`researcher_agent`](#api-reference) with [`clai`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/cli/#custom-agents) (the Pydantic AI CLI), via [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/):

It is literally these capabilities combined, in this order:

- Concise default research instructions: see [Instructions](#instructions) below
- Core [`WebSearch(local=True)`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/capabilities/web-search/) : the provider’s native web search when the model supports it, with a local DuckDuckGo fallback when it doesn’t
- Core [`WebFetch(local=True)`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/capabilities/web-fetch/) : read the pages behind the results, native where supported with a local fallback, so claims can be checked against their sources
- [`SubAgents`](/docs/ai/harness/subagents/) : delegation, with a focused web`researcher` sub-agent by default
- [`ToolOutputLimits`](/docs/ai/harness/tool-output-limits/) : bounds how much context any single tool result can consume

Pass `subagents=[]` to disable delegation, or supply your own `SubAgent` entries.

`Researcher` comes with short default research instructions (`DEFAULT_RESEARCHER_INSTRUCTIONS`, written out in full in the [blown-out equivalent](#blown-out-equivalent) below). Pass `instructions='...'` to replace them with your own, or `instructions=None` to get only the abilities, with no default instructions at all.

- **Research in a specific format** : give the agent a typed[`output_type`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/output/) : a Pydantic model of findings, each with its source link, and the researcher returns structured data instead of prose.
- **Higher-quality search** : swap in[`Exa Search`](/docs/ai/harness/exa-search/) as the search backend.
- **Fan out** : add[`Dynamic Workflow`](/docs/ai/harness/dynamic-workflow/) so the agent can spawn typed researcher sub-agents in parallel and combine their structured results.

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import WebFetch, WebSearch
from pydantic_ai_harness import SubAgent, SubAgents, ToolOutputLimits
instructions = """\
Search broadly before drawing conclusions.
Read the sources that support each important claim.
Prefer primary and authoritative sources.
Cite every factual claim with a direct source link.
Distinguish sourced facts from your own inference.
"""
sub_researcher = SubAgent(
    Agent(
        name='researcher',
        description='Research a focused sub-question on the web and report back with findings and source links',
        capabilities=[WebSearch(local=True), WebFetch(local=True), ToolOutputLimits()],
    )
)
agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5.6-sol',
    instructions=instructions,
    capabilities=[
        WebSearch(local=True),  # native provider search, DuckDuckGo fallback on models without it
        WebFetch(local=True),  # read the pages behind the results, native or local
        SubAgents(agents=[sub_researcher], agent_folders=None),
        ToolOutputLimits(),
    ],
)
```

**Bases:** `CombinedCapability[AgentDepsT]`

A complete research-agent harness built as a regular combined capability.

It comes with concise default instructions. Pass `instructions=` to
replace them, or `instructions=None` to run with no default instructions.

Model-less research agent for CLIs that load `module:variable` targets.

**Default:** `Agent(name='researcher', capabilities=[Researcher()])`
