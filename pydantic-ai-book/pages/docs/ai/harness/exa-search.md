# Exa Search

`ExaSearch` gives an agent web research tools backed by the
[Exa](https://exa.ai) search API: search that returns the most relevant
excerpts from each hit (with an optional synthesized text summary), full-page
retrieval for digging into a specific URL, and opt-in deep search that
synthesizes a cited answer in one call. The separate `ExaAgent` capability
delegates long-running research to the Exa Agent API as deferred tool calls.

While Pydantic AI Harness is on 0.x releases, the API may change between minor releases; when it does, deprecation warnings and release-note migration guidance tell you (or your agent) exactly how to upgrade. See the [version policy](/docs/ai/harness/#version-policy).

Search tools that return only titles and snippets force a second round of fetching before the agent can judge a source, while search tools that return full page text flood the context with pages the agent will discard. Wiring a search API together with a page fetcher, budgeting what each tool returns, and prompting the agent to research methodically is boilerplate every research agent reinvents.

`ExaSearch` bundles that plumbing into a single
[capability](/docs/ai/capabilities/overview/): the research tools, per-tool
output budgets, and short research guidance in the system prompt.

Install the `exa` extra and set the `EXA_API_KEY` environment variable (create
a key at [https://dashboard.exa.ai](https://dashboard.exa.ai)):

Then pass `ExaSearch` to an `Agent` via the `capabilities` parameter:

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import ExaSearch
agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', capabilities=[ExaSearch()])
result = agent.run_sync('What changed in the latest stable Python release?')
print(result.output)
```
`ExaSearch` contributes these tools to the agent:

| Tool | Purpose | 
|---|---|
| `web_search` | Search the web and return the top `num_results` pages, each with title, URL, and its most relevant excerpts. | 
| `get_page` | Retrieve the full text of one specific URL — a promising `web_search` hit, or a URL the user provided. | 
| `deep_search` | Run Exa’s multi-step deep search and return a synthesized, cited answer. Opt-in via `include_deep_search=True` . | 
| `exa_agent` | Delegate a research task to an asynchronous Exa agent run. Provided by the separate `ExaAgent` capability. | 

`web_search` returns short excerpts (Exa highlights) rather than full page
text, following [Exa’s own guidance for agents](https://exa.ai/docs/reference/search-api-guide-for-coding-agents),
so surveying several sources stays cheap; the agent reads a chosen page with
`get_page`.

`get_page` text is capped at `max_text_chars` characters, keeping the **head**
(a page’s lead carries the substance). One character of headroom above the cap
is requested from Exa, so when a page exceeds the cap the output ends with a
`[... page text truncated at N characters]` marker; at the API ceiling of
10,000 characters no headroom exists, so the marker cannot appear there. The
result count is bounded the same way: `num_results` is requested from Exa and
re-applied to the response.

A URL or question that returns no content, a rate limit, or a transient API or
network failure surfaces to the model as a
[`ModelRetry`](/docs/ai/tools-toolsets/tools-advanced/#tool-retries) rather than a
hard error: the run continues and the model can correct the URL, rephrase, or
try again. Authentication failures (401/403) are configuration errors and
propagate.

`deep_search` calls Exa search with `type='deep'` and a plain-text output
schema: Exa expands the question into multiple queries, searches, and returns
an answer grounded in citations — all in **one tool call**, with the cited
sources listed under the answer. Each call invests more time and search depth
than `web_search` (Exa’s research-grade mode), and the model decides when to
invoke tools, so the tool is off by default — enable it explicitly:

```
from pydantic_ai_harness import ExaSearch
ExaSearch(include_deep_search=True)
```
When enabled, the capability’s instructions tell the model to treat it as an
escalation from `web_search`, not a replacement. The synthesized answer is
returned in full (it is Exa-generated and inherently bounded); `max_text_chars`
only applies to `get_page`.

Set `text_summary` to have every `web_search` call also request Exa’s
plain-text output schema, so the response carries a short summary synthesized
from the results for question-style queries. Pass `True` for an unconstrained
summary, or a string describing the desired format (sent as the schema’s
`description`):

```
from pydantic_ai_harness import ExaSearch
ExaSearch(text_summary='One concise sentence with the requested facts.')
```
The tool’s return shape is unchanged and backward compatible: the result list
is returned as before, and when Exa returns a summary it is prepended as a
`Summary:` line.

Every tool returns a
[`ToolReturn`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/tools-toolsets/tools-advanced/#advanced-tool-returns):
`return_value` carries the readable text the model sees (unchanged from
previous releases, including the `Sources:` blocks), and `metadata` carries
the sources as structured `ExaSource` records (`{'url': ..., 'title': ...}`)
under the `'sources'` key. Metadata is never sent to the model; the
application reads it from the `ToolReturnPart` in the message history, so
rendering citations needs no text parsing:

```
from pydantic_ai.messages import ModelRequest, ToolReturnPart
for message in result.all_messages():
    if isinstance(message, ModelRequest):
        for part in message.parts:
            if isinstance(part, ToolReturnPart) and part.metadata is not None:
                for source in part.metadata.get('sources', []):
                    print(source['url'], source['title'])
```
`exa_agent` results additionally carry the Exa run ID in metadata under
`RUN_ID_METADATA_KEY`.

`ExaSearch` contributes short research guidance to the system prompt: search
wide with `web_search` first, read the most promising pages in full with
`get_page` before drawing conclusions, prefer primary sources, and cite the
URLs relied on. With `include_deep_search=True`, the guidance also covers when
to escalate to `deep_search`. Set `guidance` to replace the default text, or
to `''` to contribute no instructions at all.

Every field of `ExaSearch` with its default:

```
from pydantic_ai_harness import ExaSearch
ExaSearch(
    num_results=5,              # results per web_search call (1 to 100)
    max_text_chars=10_000,      # get_page text cap, in characters (1 to 10,000)
    text_summary=False,         # web_search also returns a synthesized text summary
    include_deep_search=False,  # also expose the deep_search tool
    include_domains=[],         # only search these domains (allowlist)
    exclude_domains=[],         # never search these domains (denylist)
    guidance=None,              # None = default instructions, '' = none, str = custom
    client=None,                # ExaClient -- None builds exa_py.AsyncExa from EXA_API_KEY
)
```
`include_domains` and `exclude_domains` apply to `web_search` and `deep_search`,
and are mutually exclusive — set one, not both. Out-of-range limits and
setting both domain lists raise at construction.

The Exa [Agent API](https://exa.ai/docs/reference/agent-api-guide) runs open-ended research tasks
asynchronously: a run is created, moves through `queued -> running`, and
reaches a terminal status (`completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`) after up to
an hour. The separate `ExaAgent` capability maps that lifecycle onto Pydantic
AI’s [deferred tool calls](/docs/ai/tools-toolsets/deferred-tools/): its
`exa_agent` tool creates the run and defers, carrying the Exa run ID in the
deferred call’s metadata.

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import ExaAgent
agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', capabilities=[ExaAgent()])
```
By default (`execution='inline'`) the capability resolves its own deferred
calls within the agent run by polling the Exa run to completion, so the tool
behaves like a regular (if slow) tool. With `execution='external'` the calls
bubble up as `DeferredToolRequests` output for the host application to resolve
out of band — including from a different process, since the Exa run ID
survives in the request metadata under `RUN_ID_METADATA_KEY`. The agent’s
`output_type` must include `DeferredToolRequests`, otherwise the run raises
instead of returning the deferred requests:

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.tools import DeferredToolRequests
from pydantic_ai_harness import ExaAgent
agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6',
    output_type=[str, DeferredToolRequests],
    capabilities=[ExaAgent(execution='external')],
)
```
Render a finished run with the `agent_run_result` helper, passing the same
`output_schema` the capability was constructed with so external resolution
applies the same validation and produces the same tool result shape as inline
execution, then feed the results and the original message history back into
the agent to resume the deferred run:

```
from pydantic_ai.tools import DeferredToolResults
from pydantic_ai_harness.exa import RUN_ID_METADATA_KEY, agent_run_result
async def resolve(requests, runs, output_schema=None):  # e.g. in a worker process
    results = DeferredToolResults()
    for call in requests.calls:
        run_id = requests.metadata[call.tool_call_id][RUN_ID_METADATA_KEY]
        run = await runs.poll_until_finished(run_id)
        results.calls[call.tool_call_id] = agent_run_result(run, output_schema=output_schema)
    return results
async def resume(agent, messages, results):
    return await agent.run(message_history=messages, deferred_tool_results=results)
```
Every field of `ExaAgent` with its default:

```
from pydantic_ai_harness import ExaAgent
ExaAgent(
    effort=None,            # 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'xhigh' | 'auto' -- None = API default
    execution='inline',     # 'inline' polls to completion; 'external' bubbles DeferredToolRequests
    output_schema=None,     # BaseModel class or dict schema for structured output
    system_prompt=None,     # forwarded to the Exa agent run
    poll_interval=1000,     # ms between polls when resolving inline
    timeout_ms=3_600_000,   # ms to wait for a run when resolving inline
    guidance=None,          # None = default instructions, '' = none, str = custom
    runs=None,              # ExaAgentRuns -- None builds AsyncExa().agent.runs from EXA_API_KEY
)
```
An `output_schema` model class is validated against
the completed run’s structured output (mismatches surface as `ModelRetry`),
while a dict schema is forwarded without client-side validation and is the
agent-spec form. Terminal failures (`failed`, `cancelled`) are returned to the
model as a structured message rather than raised, so the agent can decide how
to proceed. Each result includes the run ID, which the model can pass back as
`previous_run_id` to ask follow-up questions in the context of a previous run.

Two instances of the same capability register the same tool names, which is an
error. To run several differently configured instances in one agent (for
example one open-web `ExaSearch` and one pinned to specific domains), wrap the
extra instances in core’s `PrefixTools` capability, which prefixes their tool
names:

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import PrefixTools
from pydantic_ai_harness import ExaSearch
agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6',
    capabilities=[
        ExaSearch(),  # web_search, get_page
        PrefixTools(
            wrapped=ExaSearch(include_domains=['crunchbase.com'], guidance=''),
            prefix='cb',
        ),  # cb_web_search, cb_get_page
    ],
)
```
Set `guidance=''` on the wrapped instance (or replace it with text that tells
the model when to use the prefixed tools), since each instance otherwise
contributes the same default research guidance.

This also works for `ExaAgent`: it identifies its deferred calls by metadata
it wrote when deferring, not by tool name, so a prefixed `exa_agent` still
resolves inline, and multiple `ExaAgent` instances never claim each other’s
calls.

The default client is `exa_py.AsyncExa`, configured from the `EXA_API_KEY`
environment variable; when the variable is missing, construction fails with a
setup hint. Pass any object satisfying the `ExaClient` protocol — the subset of
`AsyncExa` the toolset calls — to configure authentication or the base URL
explicitly, or to substitute a fake in tests:

```
from exa_py import AsyncExa
from pydantic_ai_harness import ExaSearch
ExaSearch(client=AsyncExa(api_key='...'))
```
Pydantic AI core ships a provider-adaptive
[`WebSearch`](/docs/ai/capabilities/overview/#provider-adaptive-tools)
capability: on models with a native search tool it uses the provider’s own
search, executed server-side; elsewhere it falls back to a local DuckDuckGo
tool. Reach for it when you want search that follows the model.

Reach for `ExaSearch` when you want the same search behavior on every model:
one vendor, excerpts with every hit, explicit page retrieval, domain filters,
and opt-in deep search.

One caveat when combining them: on Anthropic models the provider-native search
tool is also named `web_search` on the wire, so
`capabilities=[WebSearch(), ExaSearch()]` puts two tools with the same name in
the request. Use one search capability per agent on native-search models, or
force the local fallback with `WebSearch(native=False)` (its DuckDuckGo tool is
named `duckduckgo_search`, which does not collide).

Exa also ships an official hosted MCP server at `https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp`
([exa-labs/exa-mcp-server](https://github.com/exa-labs/exa-mcp-server)). By
default it exposes `web_search_exa` and `web_fetch_exa`; the full catalog adds
`web_search_advanced_exa` and an agent-run set (`agent_create_run`,
`agent_wait_for_run`, `agent_get_run_output`, `agent_cancel_run`).

`ExaSearch` is the curated, typed path: bounded output, a retry-on-empty
contract, bundled research instructions, and a client seam that makes it
testable offline. The MCP server is how you get Exa’s full catalog with zero
wrapper code, via Pydantic AI core’s MCP capability. Their agent runs are
create-then-poll (`agent_create_run` returns an ID immediately;
`agent_wait_for_run` polls it), where `deep_search` returns the answer in a
single call. The two compose in one `capabilities` list, and none of the MCP
tool names collide with `web_search`, `get_page`, or `deep_search`:

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import MCP
from pydantic_ai_harness import ExaSearch
agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', capabilities=[ExaSearch(), MCP('https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp')])
```
`ExaSearch` works with Pydantic AI’s
[agent spec](/docs/ai/core-concepts/agent-spec/), so you can declare it in a config
file instead of Python:

```
# agent.yaml
model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6
capabilities:
  - ExaSearch:
      num_results: 3
      include_deep_search: true
  - ExaAgent:
      effort: low
```
```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import ExaAgent, ExaSearch
agent = Agent.from_file('agent.yaml', custom_capability_types=[ExaSearch, ExaAgent])
```
Pass `custom_capability_types` so the spec loader knows how to instantiate the
capabilities. The `client` and `runs` fields are not spec-serializable;
spec-loaded instances always build the default client from `EXA_API_KEY`. In
specs, `output_schema` takes the JSON-schema dict form; Pydantic model
classes are only available when constructing the capability in Python.

**Bases:** `AbstractCapability[AgentDepsT]`

Web research for agents, backed by the [Exa](https://exa.ai) search API.

Adds two tools: `web_search`, which returns search results with their most
relevant excerpts, and `get_page`, which retrieves the full text of a
specific URL. Set `text_summary` to have `web_search` also return a
synthesized text summary with the results. Set `include_deep_search=True`
to also expose `deep_search`, which runs Exa’s multi-step deep search and
returns a synthesized, cited answer in one tool call.

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness.exa import ExaSearch
agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', capabilities=[ExaSearch()])
```
Authentication comes from the `EXA_API_KEY` environment variable by
default; pass `client` to configure it explicitly.

Exa client to use; when `None`, an `exa_py.AsyncExa` is built from `EXA_API_KEY`.

Any object satisfying the `ExaClient` protocol works: use it to pass an API
key explicitly, point at a different base URL, or substitute a fake in tests.

**Type:** `ExaClient` | `None`**Default:** `None`

Search results never come from these domains (denylist).

Applies to `web_search` and `deep_search`. Mutually exclusive with
`include_domains`.

**Type:** [`Sequence`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Sequence)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)] **Default:** `field(default_factory=(list[str]))`

Custom research guidance for the system prompt.

Leave as `None` for the default guidance (which adapts to
`include_deep_search`), or set `''` to contribute no instructions at all.

**Type:** [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) | `None`**Default:** `None`

Also expose the `deep_search` tool. Off by default.

Deep search (Exa search `type='deep'`) runs a multi-step agentic search
and synthesizes a cited answer in one call. Each call invests more time
and search depth than `web_search` (Exa’s research-grade mode), and the
model decides when to invoke tools, so that investment is opt-in rather
than the default.

**Type:** `bool`**Default:** `False`

If non-empty, search results only come from these domains (allowlist).

Applies to `web_search` and `deep_search`. Mutually exclusive with
`exclude_domains`.

**Type:** [`Sequence`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Sequence)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)] **Default:** `field(default_factory=(list[str]))`

Maximum characters of page text `get_page` returns (1 to 10,000, the Exa API range).

One character of headroom above the cap is requested from Exa so local truncation can detect a longer page and append a truncation marker. At the API ceiling of 10,000 no headroom exists, so the marker cannot fire there.

**Type:** `int`**Default:** `10000`

Number of results `web_search` returns per query (1 to 100, the Exa API range).

**Type:** `int`**Default:** `5`

Have `web_search` also return a synthesized text summary above the results. Off by default.

When enabled, each `web_search` call requests Exa’s plain-text output
schema, so the response carries a short summary synthesized from the
results in addition to the result list. Pass a string to describe the
desired summary format (it is sent as the schema’s `description`), or
`True` for an unconstrained summary. The tool’s return shape is unchanged:
the summary is prepended as a `Summary:` line when Exa returns one.

**Type:** [`bool`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool) | `str`**Default:** `False`

```
def __post_init__() -> None
```
Validate configuration against the Exa API’s documented bounds.

`@classmethod`

```
def from_spec(
    cls,
    *,
    num_results: int = 5,
    max_text_chars: int = 10000,
    text_summary: bool | str = False,
    include_deep_search: bool = False,
    include_domains: Sequence[str] = (),
    exclude_domains: Sequence[str] = (),
    guidance: str | None = None,
) -> ExaSearch[AgentDepsT]
```
Construct the capability from serializable spec options.

The `client` field is not spec-serializable, so spec-loaded instances
always build the default `exa_py.AsyncExa` from `EXA_API_KEY`.

`ExaSearch`[`AgentDepsT`]

```
def get_instructions() -> AgentInstructions[AgentDepsT] | None
```
Static research guidance: search wide, read the promising pages in full, cite URLs.

When `include_deep_search` is set, the default guidance also covers
when to escalate to `deep_search`. A non-`None` `guidance` replaces the
default; `''` disables instructions entirely.

`AgentInstructions`[`AgentDepsT`] | `None`

```
def get_toolset() -> ExaSearchToolset[AgentDepsT]
```
Build the toolset providing `web_search`, `get_page`, and the optional `deep_search` tool.

`ExaSearchToolset`[`AgentDepsT`]

**Bases:** `AbstractCapability[AgentDepsT]`

Delegation of deep research tasks to the [Exa](https://exa.ai) Agent API.

Adds one tool, `exa_agent`, which creates an asynchronous Exa agent run
(queued -> running -> terminal, up to an hour) and defers the tool call.
By default the capability resolves its own deferred calls inline by
polling the run to completion. With `execution='external'` the calls
surface as `DeferredToolRequests` output instead, for the host application
to resolve out of band (the run ID is in the request metadata under
`RUN_ID_METADATA_KEY`), including across process restarts.

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness.exa import ExaAgent
agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', capabilities=[ExaAgent()])
```
Authentication comes from the `EXA_API_KEY` environment variable by
default; pass `runs` to configure it explicitly.

How much work the Exa agent invests per run; `None` uses the API default.

**Type:** `AgentEffort` | `None`**Default:** `None`

How deferred `exa_agent` calls are resolved.

With `'inline'`, the capability polls the run to completion during the
agent run. With `'external'`, calls bubble up as `DeferredToolRequests`
output for the host application to resolve (see `agent_run_result`), which
suits durable workers that outlive a single process.

**Type:** [`Literal`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Literal)[‘inline’, ‘external’] **Default:** `'inline'`

Custom delegation guidance for the system prompt.

Leave as `None` for the default guidance, or set `''` to contribute no
instructions at all.

**Type:** [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) | `None`**Default:** `None`

Structured output schema for the Exa agent’s result. `None` returns prose.

Accepts a Pydantic model class or a JSON-schema-style dict. A model class is forwarded to the API and a completed run’s structured output is validated against it (a mismatch surfaces as a retry). The dict form skips client-side validation and is the serializable shape used by agent specs.

**Type:** [`type`](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-type)[`BaseModel`] | [`dict`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#dict)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str), [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-object)] | `None`**Default:** `None`

Milliseconds between polls while resolving a run inline.

**Type:** `int`**Default:** `1000`

Exa Agent runs client; when `None`, `exa_py.AsyncExa().agent.runs` is built from `EXA_API_KEY`.

Any object satisfying the `ExaAgentRuns` protocol works: use it to pass an
API key explicitly or substitute a fake in tests.

**Type:** `ExaAgentRuns` | `None`**Default:** `None`

System prompt forwarded to the Exa agent run; `None` uses the API default.

**Type:** [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) | `None`**Default:** `None`

Milliseconds to wait for a run to finish when resolving inline.

**Type:** `int`**Default:** `3600000`

`@classmethod`

```
def from_spec(
    cls,
    *,
    effort: AgentEffort | None = None,
    execution: Literal['inline', 'external'] = 'inline',
    output_schema: dict[str, object] | None = None,
    system_prompt: str | None = None,
    poll_interval: int = 1000,
    timeout_ms: int = 3600000,
    guidance: str | None = None,
) -> ExaAgent[AgentDepsT]
```
Construct the capability from serializable spec options.

The `runs` field is not spec-serializable, so spec-loaded instances
always build the default client from `EXA_API_KEY`. `output_schema`
takes the JSON-schema dict form here; Pydantic model classes are only
available when constructing the capability in Python.

`ExaAgent`[`AgentDepsT`]

```
def get_instructions() -> AgentInstructions[AgentDepsT] | None
```
Static delegation guidance: when to hand a task to `exa_agent`, and run ID continuation.

A non-`None` `guidance` replaces the default; `''` disables
instructions entirely.

`AgentInstructions`[`AgentDepsT`] | `None`

```
def get_toolset() -> ExaAgentToolset[AgentDepsT]
```
Build the toolset providing the `exa_agent` tool.

`ExaAgentToolset`[`AgentDepsT`]

`@async`

```
def handle_deferred_tool_calls(
    ctx: RunContext[AgentDepsT],
    *,
    requests: DeferredToolRequests,
) -> DeferredToolResults | None
```
Resolve deferred `exa_agent` calls inline by polling the Exa run to completion.

With `execution='external'` all calls are left unresolved, so they
bubble up as `DeferredToolRequests` output for the host application to
resolve; the Exa run ID is available in
`requests.metadatatool_call_id`.

Calls are claimed by the instance token in the deferred-call metadata
rather than by tool name, so tool renaming or prefixing wrappers (e.g.
`PrefixTools`) do not break inline resolution.

```
def agent_run_result(
    run: AgentRun,
    *,
    output_schema: type[BaseModel] | dict[str, object] | None = None,
) -> ToolReturn[str]
```
Render a terminal Exa agent run as the `exa_agent` tool result.

Use it when resolving externally executed `exa_agent` calls in a host
application (building `DeferredToolResults`), so external and inline
execution produce the same result shape. When `output_schema` is a
Pydantic model class, a completed run’s structured output is validated
against it; a mismatch raises `ModelRetry`.

The `ToolReturn.return_value` text is what the model sees; its metadata
carries the run ID under `RUN_ID_METADATA_KEY` and the citation `sources`
(`ExaSource` dicts) for the application to use directly.

**Bases:** `TypedDict`

One source behind a tool result, carried in `ToolReturn.metadata['sources']`.
