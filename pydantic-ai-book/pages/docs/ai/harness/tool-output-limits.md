# Tool Output Limits

`ToolOutputLimits` reduces a tool return that is large enough to dominate the context
window. Tool returns persist in history as `ToolReturnPart`s, so an oversized one is re-sent
on every later model request, paying its token cost for the rest of the run. This capability
intercepts a return when it is produced, reduces it once, and lets the reduced form persist —
the reduction is not recomputed per request.

While Pydantic AI Harness is on 0.x releases, the API may change between minor releases; when it does, deprecation warnings and release-note migration guidance tell you (or your agent) exactly how to upgrade. See the [version policy](/docs/ai/harness/#version-policy).

A tool can return a payload large enough to dominate the context window: a big file read, a verbose log, a large JSON document. Because tool returns persist in history, an oversized one is re-sent on every later model request, paying its token cost for the rest of the run.

This is the overflow-to-file follow-up the [compaction](/docs/ai/harness/compaction/) capability names as out
of scope: it moves large tool outputs *out* of the window at production time, rather than
compressing or dropping context already inside it.

| Mode | Cost | Lossy? | What the model gets | 
|---|---|---|---|
| `Truncate` | zero-LLM | yes | A head / tail / head+tail clamp of the text | 
| `Spill` | zero-LLM | no | A handle + preview + shape sketch; full payload read back on demand | 
| `Summarize` | one LLM call | yes | A size-gated summary (inherits the run’s model by default) | 

`Spill` is lossless: the full payload is persisted and the model reads slices of it through
the registered `read_tool_result(handle, offset, limit, from_end, pattern)` tool (the Claude
Code pattern, the core [#4352](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/issues/4352) design).
That tool is bounded: `offset >= 0`, `limit` clamped to a built-in line cap, the joined output
capped, and `pattern` is a literal substring (not a regex), so a model-supplied value cannot
hang the host with catastrophic backtracking.

Construct an `Agent` with `ToolOutputLimits()` in its `capabilities`. With no arguments it
uses the default band: spill returns of 10,000 characters or more, with a bounded truncation
fallback if the store cannot accept the write.

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import ToolOutputLimits
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', capabilities=[ToolOutputLimits()])
```
The capability registers a single `read_tool_result` tool so the model can page back into any
spilled payload. Its own returns are exempt from reduction.

Configure an ordered list of size `bands`. Each band is a `(over, action)` pair: when a
return’s measured size reaches `over`, its action runs. The band with the largest threshold
that fits wins; anything below the smallest threshold passes through.

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import ToolOutputLimits
from pydantic_ai_harness.tool_output_limits import Band, Spill, Summarize, Truncate
agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    capabilities=[
        ToolOutputLimits(
            bands=[
                Band(over=100_000, action=Spill()),      # huge: keep losslessly, read back on demand
                Band(over=20_000, action=Summarize()),    # large: compress with the run's model
                Band(over=5_000, action=Truncate()),      # medium: cheap clamp
            ],
            # below 5,000: passthrough
        )
    ],
)
```
The default band, when you pass no `bands`, is `Spill(then=Truncate())` at a 10,000-character
threshold: lossless when a store accepts the write, a bounded truncation otherwise — zero LLM
cost and no silent drop.

`Passthrough()` is an explicit no-op action for `bands` or `per_tool` lists, leaving matching
returns untouched.

Every action takes an optional `then`, applied when the action cannot run: a `Spill` whose
store errors, a `Truncate` / `Summarize` on a binary payload, a `Summarize` whose model call
raises. `then` chains, so `Summarize(then=Spill(then=Truncate()))` degrades summarize ->
spill -> truncate.

`per_tool` replaces the global band list for named tools (file reads to `head`, logs to
`tail`); `tool_filter` (a `ToolSelector`) scopes which tools the capability touches at all.

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import ToolOutputLimits
from pydantic_ai_harness.tool_output_limits import Band, Truncate, TruncationStrategy
agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    capabilities=[
        ToolOutputLimits(
            per_tool={
                'read_file': [Band(over=8_000, action=Truncate(strategy=TruncationStrategy.head))],
                'run_shell': [Band(over=8_000, action=Truncate(strategy=TruncationStrategy.tail))],
            },
            tool_filter=['read_file', 'run_shell', 'search'],
        )
    ],
)
```
`TruncationStrategy` has three members: `head` (keep the first characters, good for headers and
schemas), `tail` (keep the last characters, good for build and test output where errors land
last), and `head_tail` (keep both ends, elide the middle — the default).

Set `Truncate(keep_tail_lines=N)` to reserve the final N lines before allocating the rest of
the character budget. The default is zero, which leaves existing truncation behavior unchanged.

```
from pydantic_ai_harness.tool_output_limits import Band, ToolOutputLimits, Truncate, TruncationStrategy
truncate = Truncate(max_chars=4_000, strategy=TruncationStrategy.head, keep_tail_lines=2)
limits = ToolOutputLimits(bands=[], per_tool={'run_command': [Band(over=4_000, action=truncate)]})
```
With `head`, the remaining content budget keeps the beginning of the output. With
`head_tail`, it is split 2:3 between the beginning and the text immediately before the
reserved lines. `tail` continues to keep the end. Markers and all retained characters count
toward `max_chars`.

The cap takes priority. If the requested lines exceed it, truncation falls back to the
usual tail strategy; if they fit but a full marker would displace them, the result is a
bare tail slice within the cap. This does not invoke `then` or guarantee that an oversized
control trailer remains intact.

Lines are separated by LF or CRLF, and their existing endings are retained. A terminating
newline does not add a line, but a blank final line counts. Requesting more lines than exist
selects the whole text, subject to the same cap. Negative `keep_tail_lines` values are rejected.

This applies to the text after serialization and optional ANSI stripping, independently
for `ToolReturn.return_value` and textual `content`. Binary fallbacks are unchanged.
Tail-line selection adds no telemetry spans: it is a slicing choice within the existing
tool-result reduction, rather than a separate operation.

Keep Shell’s native `max_output_chars` above the `ToolOutputLimits` thresholds. Use
`tail` truncation for moderate command output and `Spill` for large output:

```
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness.shell import Shell
from pydantic_ai_harness.tool_output_limits import (
    Band,
    Spill,
    ToolOutputLimits,
    Truncate,
    TruncationStrategy,
)
tail = Truncate(max_chars=4_000, strategy=TruncationStrategy.tail)
agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5.6-sol',
    capabilities=[
        Shell(allowed_commands=['git', 'rg', 'pytest'], max_output_chars=100_000),
        ToolOutputLimits(
            bands=[],
            per_tool={
                'run_command': [
                    Band(over=20_000, action=Spill(then=tail)),
                    Band(over=4_000, action=tail),
                ],
            },
        ),
    ],
)
```
Only `run_command` uses these bands; `bands=[]` leaves other tools to their native limits.
A tail slice retains an exit-code trailer when it fits in the retained suffix. It does not
guarantee that an entire line survives a small budget; `head` can remove the trailer.

Shell applies its native cap before `ToolOutputLimits` sees the result. With the spill
threshold below that cap, a natively truncated result is stored instead of being truncated
again, unless the store fails. The spill preview shows both ends and the model can use
`read_tool_result` to inspect the stored text.

Spilling preserves only the result received from Shell. It cannot recover content already
removed by the native cap. A preview can contain both spill and native truncation notices;
a native notice describes the stored result, not the shorter preview. A positive
`Spill.preview_chars` value controls the preview’s content budget; its header and omission
marker add to that length.

A `ToolReturn` carries a `return_value` and an optional `content` that core renders as a
separate, model-visible part which also persists in history. This capability measures and
reduces both with the same band logic (they spill to distinct handles). Text `content` is
reduced in place; non-text `content` (multimodal parts) that overflows is left unreduced with
a `warnings.warn`, since it cannot be safely truncated.

Thresholds are measured in characters by default. Set `over_tokens=True` to measure in
estimated tokens (the same ~4-chars-per-token heuristic as [compaction](/docs/ai/harness/compaction/)); pass a
`tokenizer` callable for accuracy. `Truncate.max_chars` is always characters — truncation is a
character operation regardless of the threshold unit. The cap includes the truncation marker
and applies separately to each reduced text value. If the budget cannot fit both retained
content and a complete marker, truncation keeps the selected slice without a marker. A
non-positive cap returns an empty string. Set `strip_ansi=True` to strip ANSI escape sequences
from text returns before measuring and reducing.

A spilled structured return is stored as compact JSON: one long line. `read_tool_result`
pages by line, so page 1 returns the whole payload and page 2 is empty. Setting `serializer`
stores the value in a layout with real lines instead:

```
from pydantic_ai_harness.tool_output_limits import ToolOutputLimits, indented_json, json_lines
ToolOutputLimits(serializer=indented_json)  # one field per line
ToolOutputLimits(serializer=json_lines)  # one record per line
```
Use `json_lines` for tools that return lists of records: line N is record N, so page offsets
and `pattern` matches line up with whole records. Anything that is not a list-like sequence
falls back to `indented_json` — including a list wrapped in a dict, so return the list
directly for per-record paging. Use `indented_json` for everything else.

Any `(value) -> str` callable works too, but prefer the presets: they escape the Unicode
line separators (U+0085/U+2028/U+2029) that would otherwise knock read-back offsets off the
line grid. The serialized text is also what gets measured, so an indented layout can cross
a size band that compact JSON would not. Strings and binary returns are never serialized,
returns below the smallest band pass through untouched, and a serializer that raises or
returns non-text warns and falls back to compact JSON rather than losing the tool output.

Spilled payloads go through the narrow `OverflowStore` protocol. The default `LocalFileStore`
writes one file per `(run_id, tool_call_id, retry)` under a stable root directory and keeps it
after the run, so a later `read_tool_result` — in this run or a subsequent agent/run — can
still reach it. The handle is backend-addressable (a relative key), not an absolute local
path, so a durable backend (Temporal, a blob store, or the core `ExecutionEnvironment`
workspace once #4352 lands) can resolve the same handle in another process. Supply your own
backend with `store=...`.

```
from typing import Protocol
class OverflowStore(Protocol):
    async def write(self, key: str, data: bytes) -> str: ...   # returns a handle
    async def read(self, handle: str) -> bytes: ...
```
The store root is stable and shareable on purpose — spilled files must be readable by a later
agent or run — so security does not come from per-instance isolation. It comes from two
mechanisms: the root is created with `0700` (owner-only) permissions, and `read` resolves the
target (following symlinks) and rejects anything that escapes the root via symlink, `..`, or
an absolute path. Handle segments are also sanitized so a crafted handle cannot traverse out.

By default the store keeps spilled files forever — deleting on run end would break a later agent that still wants to read a spill. To bound disk use, opt into age-based pruning:

```
from datetime import timedelta
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import ToolOutputLimits
from pydantic_ai_harness.tool_output_limits import LocalFileStore
store = LocalFileStore(cleanup_after=timedelta(hours=6))  # default: None = keep forever
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', capabilities=[ToolOutputLimits(store=store)])
```
When set, a `write` schedules a background prune (a daemon thread, off the hot path) that
deletes files whose modification time (`st_mtime`) is older than `cleanup_after`. Pruning is
non-blocking and non-erroring: any failure is caught and surfaced via `warnings.warn`, never
propagated into the agent run, so cleanup can never fail a run or block the hot path.
Last-read time (`st_atime`) is unreliable on `noatime`/`relatime` mounts and is not used.

Prefer external cleanup (cron, a sweeper) over the in-process TTL? Point it at the store root and delete by mtime:

```
import time
from pathlib import Path
root = Path('/tmp/pyai_harness_overflow')  # or your configured base_dir
cutoff = time.time() - 6 * 3600
for path in root.rglob('*'):
    if path.is_file() and path.stat().st_mtime < cutoff:
        path.unlink(missing_ok=True)
```
A built-in `Summarize` call is a real request to the model, so its full usage — tokens and the
request itself — folds into the run’s `ctx.usage`, exactly like `SummarizingCompaction`. Its nested
run receives the parent limits unchanged except that a finite request limit reserves one request for
the pending parent request.

By default `Summarize` inherits the running agent’s model (`ctx.model`). Pass a model id or
instance to `Summarize(model=...)` to override, or a `summarize` callable to bypass the
built-in prompt entirely. The `summary_prompt` template on the capability must contain both
`{tool_name}` and `{output}` placeholders.

With a durable-execution capability attached, built-in model summarization is a journaled
capability operation. `ToolOutputLimits` carries the stable default `id='tool_output_limits'`, so
durable recovery works without configuration.

Two details matter when choosing a band under durability. The text being summarized is part of the
journaled operation input, so prefer `Spill` over built-in `Summarize` for outputs near the
engine’s payload limit. And a custom `summarize` callable runs directly rather than as a durable
operation — arbitrary callables cannot be reconstructed on the worker side — so it may be called
again on replay.

- Binary returns spill verbatim and are never stringify-truncated; `Truncate` /`Summarize` on binary fall through to`then` .
- Structured / nested returns spill (or summarize) by preference — truncating JSON produces
invalid JSON. `Spill` includes a one-line shape sketch of the top level.
- `ModelRetry` and tool errors never reach this hook (they are raised, not returned), so the
model always gets the full error it needs to recover.
- A large `ToolReturn.content` is reduced with the same bands as`return_value` ; non-text
content that overflows is left unreduced with a warning.
- Multiple oversized returns in one step get distinct handles (keyed per `tool_call_id` );
retries get distinct handles too (keyed per`retry` ), so a retried call never clobbers the
earlier attempt’s spill.

- Distinct from [compaction](/docs/ai/harness/compaction/) , which compresses or drops context already inside
the window; this capability moves large tool outputs out of the window at production time.
- Consumes core [#4352](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/issues/4352) (the canonical
queryable-file primitive) through the`OverflowStore` seam once it lands.
- Distinct from `ClampOversizedMessages` , which clamps runaway model responses, not tool
returns.

**Bases:** `AbstractCapability[AgentDepsT]`

Reduce oversized tool returns when they are produced, persisting the reduction.

A tool can return a payload large enough to dominate the context window. Tool returns
persist in history, so an oversized one is re-sent on every later request. This
capability intercepts a return in `after_tool_execute`, reduces it once, and lets the
reduced form persist — it is not recomputed per request.

Three reduction modes, freely combined through an ordered list of size `bands`:

- `Truncate` : clamp to a character budget. Lossy, zero-cost.
- `Spill` : persist the full payload, hand the model a`read_tool_result` handle plus a
preview. Lossless.
- `Summarize` : size-gated LLM summary. Inherits the run’s model by default.

The first band whose `over` threshold the measured size meets wins; smaller returns pass
through. `per_tool` replaces the band list for named tools; `tool_filter` scopes which
tools are touched at all. The default is `Spill(then=Truncate())`: lossless when a store
accepts the write, a bounded truncation otherwise.

`ModelRetry` and other errors never reach this hook (they are raised, not returned), so
error payloads the model needs to recover are never spilled or summarized.

Ordered size bands. The first band whose `over` threshold is met wins.

**Type:** [`Sequence`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Sequence)[`Band`] **Default:** `field(default_factory=_default_bands)`

Per-tool band lists that replace `bands` for the named tools.

**Type:** [`Mapping`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Mapping)[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str), [`Sequence`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Sequence)[`Band`]] **Default:** `field(default_factory=(dict[str, Sequence[Band]]))`

Which tools this capability touches. Non-matching tools always pass through.

**Type:** `ToolSelector`[`AgentDepsT`] **Default:** `'all'`

Measure band thresholds in estimated tokens instead of characters.

**Type:** `bool`**Default:** `False`

Optional `(str) -> int` tokenizer for `over_tokens`. Defaults to a ~4-char heuristic.

**Type:** [`Callable`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Callable)[[[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/stdtypes.html#str)], [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/builtins/functions.html#int)] | `None`**Default:** `None`

Backend for spilled payloads. Defaults to a `LocalFileStore`.

**Type:** `OverflowStore` | `None`**Default:** `None`

Strip ANSI escape sequences from text returns before measuring and reducing.

**Type:** `bool`**Default:** `False`

Prompt template for `Summarize`. Must contain `{tool_name}` and `{output}`.

**Type:** `str`**Default:** `_DEFAULT_SUMMARY_PROMPT`

Render a structured (non-string, non-binary) return to the text that is measured,
previewed, spilled, and read back. When unset, structured returns render as compact
JSON, which puts the whole value on one line; the `indented_json` and `json_lines`
presets make large spills pageable by line through `read_tool_result`. A return that
stays under every band threshold passes through as the original object, so the
serialized text is only model-visible once a band triggers.

**Type:** `Serializer` | `None`**Default:** `None`

```
def get_toolset() -> AgentToolset[AgentDepsT] | None
```
Register the `read_tool_result` tool for reading spilled payloads on demand.

[`AgentToolset`](/docs/ai/api/pydantic-ai/toolsets/#pydantic_ai.toolsets.AgentToolset)[`AgentDepsT`] | `None`

`@async`

```
def after_tool_execute(
    ctx: RunContext[AgentDepsT],
    *,
    call: ToolCallPart,
    tool_def: ToolDefinition,
    args: dict[str, Any],
    result: Any,
) -> Any
```
Reduce the tool result — both `return_value` and model-visible `content`.
